I just wanted to post a quick update that my first shelf of Gloomspite Gitz is complete! I want to get them all out
at some point and get some better photos, but for now you can get an idea of how they all look together.

This shelf largely holds the majority of the squigs in my army. The second shelf will hold the troggoths and grots
themselves.
