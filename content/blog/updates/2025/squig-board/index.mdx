I finished a shelf in my cabinet of Gloomspite Gitz and although they looked great I thought they could look better.
So I decided to create a diorama board to display them on. The idea wasn't to create anything too complex or fancy,
I mainly wanted to fill the shelf and print out a backdrop. As I have 16 shelves to eventually fill, I wanted to keep it
simple so I could replicate the process for the other shelves.

To create the board I cut a piece of MDF to size of the shelf, then cut some cork board the height of the bases to the
same size (my cork board was too small so it took a few pieces). Before gluing the cork to the MDF I planned out
where the squigs would go and cut out holes in the cork for the squig bases to sit in.

After gluing the cork to the MDF I used some offcuts of the cork to build up some rocky areas, then covered it all with
some mud effects, then some ground cover from Geek Gaming Scenics to match the basing on the miniatures. I then added
a layer of watered down PVA glue to seal it all in place.

The final steps were to paint the rocks and stones grey, then add a huge amount of grass tufts and flowers to once again
match the basing on the miniatures. The last step was to paint the edges of the board black to give it a clean finish.

It's nothing special, but I like that as it doesn't take anything away from the miniatures. The backdrop is a
printout of a Gloomspite Gitz piece of art, which I think works well. Hopefully it will start to look really good once
I fill more shelves with more complete boards.
