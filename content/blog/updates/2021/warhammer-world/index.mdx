I was looking back through old photos and found some of a trip to Warhammer World back in 2018.

It was a fun couple of hours walking round and seeing all the epic dioramas that I'd only ever seen in White Dwarf
or online. I'm not sure how often new dioramas are brought in, but seeing as this was before Age of Sigmar I imagine
there's been a lot of change in the last few years.

Anyway I thought I'd share the photos and who knows, maybe I'll have another trip there in the future!
