So I've finally painted all the Kruleboyz I currently own. There's a few more to pickup, I think I still need a
Underworlds unit, a Warcry unit and a 2022 event exclusive shaman. But for now this is one of everything.

This is maybe the biggest painted army I now own. It definitely compares to my Squigs, as well as my Grey Knights and
Space Wolves. It great to see them all together and I'm really looking forward to getting my Gloomspite Gitz complete
in the future and to put them all together.

One day I'd love to get some Ironjaws and have a complete Orruk Warclans army lead by Kragnos!
