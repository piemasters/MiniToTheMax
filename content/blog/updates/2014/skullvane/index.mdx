Skullvane Manse is my first piece of terrain to go with my Realm of Battle Boards. Now out of production I’m really
glad that I managed to get it! Having spotted it was no longer available in the UK and no local Games Workshop stores
had it in stock either, I managed to pick up the last one from the US and it was well worth the postage cost, which
thankfully includes the import tax.

It’s easily the most impressive terrain kit I’ve seen Games Workshop produce and I’m really surprised its no longer
sold. It's a massive piece of scenery and will always likely be the centerpiece when playing games of fantasy and
makes a great objective for both armies to reach, or for one army to defeat the sorcerer at top, while the other
army attempts to defend them.

With the first base colours down its starting to get there, but there’s still a long way to go! Next up, get the
roof finished. I will look at putting together my own tutorial on how I've painted it once it has been completed.
