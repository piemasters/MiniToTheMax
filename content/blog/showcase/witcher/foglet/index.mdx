## Miniature Review

The Foglet is one of the smallest miniatures in the box. It's a fairly simple sculpt, but has a good amount of detail
on the face and a number of bones and mushrooms on the base. The cutout in the stomach looks a bit odd, but does make
it easy to add the famous glow.

## Painting Techniques

### Body

<Paint name={'Aethermatic Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Drakenhof Nightshade'} />
<Paint name={'Coelia Greenshade'} />
<Paint name={'Sotek Green'} />
<Paint name={'White Scar'} />

Sotek Green and White Scar was mixed to get the final highlight.

### Fire & Eyes

<Paint name={'Bad Moon Yellow'} />
<Paint name={'Imperial Fist'} />
<Paint name={'Dorn Yellow'} />

### Teeth

<Paint name={'Aggaros Dunes'} />

### Gums

<Paint name={'Volupus Pink'} />

## Base

### Dirt

<Paint name={'Ratling Grime'} />

### Rocks

<Paint name={'Basilicanum Grey'} />

### Bones

<Paint name={'Aggaros Dunes'} />

### Mushrooms

<Paint name={'Briar Queen Chiil'} />
<Paint name={'Drakenhof Nightshade'} />

### Rim

<Paint name={'Abaddon Black'} />

For all miniatures in the set I'm using a mix of GamersGrass tufts and flowers.

## Roundup

To start with I really wasn't sure what colors to use. I wanted a dark bluish green, but didn't want it too dark to
hide the details or too light to look like a fish monster. I think I got it about right, I could maybe have made the
skin a bit more green, but I didn't want it looking like a goblin or orc. The glowing belly has come out ok for only
using a few colors.
