## Miniature Review

The Arachas is a bit of a weird one. It's like a crab with a flower for a face which is weird by itself, but then
it has a weird bulbous lump of a body. Only in the Witcher world!

The sculpt itself is really good, using slapchop helped to surface a lot of details on the body I hadn't realized was
there. As the miniature only really has two surfaces, the body and the flower, it's really good as it adds the
opportunity to add a bit more color.

## Roundup

I ended up adding quite a few layers to the skin but I'm really happy with how it came out. It stops it being too plain
but isn't over the top so helps it look more plant like. I could have spent a bit more time on the flower as its the
focus point, but I don't want to spend too much time on any of these as I'll get bored and move onto another project
before I finish them.
