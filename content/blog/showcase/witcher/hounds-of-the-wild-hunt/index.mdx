> Baying at the heels of the Wild hunt are its Hounds, fierce beasts which follow it like dust clouds trailing after a

> death following in their wake.

## Miniature Review

These look just like the artwork, they look just like big chunks of ice grown over the top of a wild beast. I've not
looked into the rules yet to know why they are six of them when there is only one of every other monster, but I like
there being varying numbers of them on each base and how they're crawling over each other.

## Painting Techniques

### Body

<Paint name={'Pylar Glacier'} />
<Paint name={'Drakenhof Nightshade'} />
<Paint name={'Etherium Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Praxeti White'} />
<Paint name={'Pylar Glacier'} />

### Eyes

<Paint name={'Evil Sunz Scarlet'} />
<Paint name={'Dorn Yellow'} />

## Base

### Dirt

<Paint name={'Ratling Grime'} />

### Rocks

<Paint name={'Space Wolves Grey'} />

### Rim

<Paint name={'Abaddon Black'} />

For all miniatures in the set I'm using a mix of GamersGrass tufts and flowers.

## Roundup

The Pylar Glacier paint really didn't give me the coverage I wanted, and the Drakenhof Nightshade shade dried a lot
darker than I was hoping. I might have been better using Aethermatic Blue and Tyran Blue to get a nicer blue ice
effect, but I managed to salvage them with some heavy drybrushing.

I'm not sure if I ruined them a bit by painting the eyes. I felt like they needed some detail, and although I wanted
to paint them blue I didn't think they would stand out, so went with how i'd done others. I think they contrast a bit
too much but it does make them easy to spot at least.
