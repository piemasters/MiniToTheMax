## Miniature Review

The Barghest is an interesting one as I've seen them represented as both ghosts and creatures with more physical bodies.
That can make it hard for sculpting the miniature but I think they've done it in a way where it works fairly well for
painting it as either.

The ridges on the body do seem to be more vein-like or the flow of energy flowing through the ghostly body, but from a
distance I think you could get away with painting it as fur if you wanted. Beyond that the sculpt is fairly simple, but
I really like the pose especially being on the slanted rock.

## Painting Techniques

### Skin

<Paint name={'Hexwraith Flame'} />
<Paint name={'Tesseract Glow'} />

## Base

### Rock

<Paint name={'Basilicanum Grey'} />

### Dirt

<Paint name={'Garaghaks Sewer'} />
<Paint name={'Karak Stone'} />

### Rim

<Paint name={'Abaddon Black'} />

For all miniatures in the set I'm using a mix of GamersGrass tufts and flowers.

## Roundup

I kept this one really simple just to see how far I could take the contrast paints without needing to go and apply a
number of highlights after them. Initially I tried just using Hexwraith as I've used for ghosts before, but it seemed
a bit too simple and flat. Adding some Tesseract Glow in while the paint was still wet created a really nice effect,
matching the colors much closer to the artwork.
