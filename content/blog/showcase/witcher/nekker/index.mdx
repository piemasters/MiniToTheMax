## Miniature Review

Nekkers aren't too different to Foglets. It doesn't have a hole in its belly and is sporting a loincloth. It also
has a good number of chins, and a taller base than usual to help give him some height. I would have liked to see some
long claws and a bit more detail in the face, but other than that he fits in well with the others.

## Roundup

It's not my best paint job but as with a lot of the others I wanted to get it painted quickly and to standout compared
to the Foglet. I think the pale human skin, along with the purple glaze in the recesses, gives it a very sickly
monstery look.
