## Miniature Review

I think the Leshen, or Leshy, is the most iconic Witcher monster. The sculpt is great and is instantly recognizable. The
wood grain being sculpted in makes painting really easy, and the antlers are just the right size with a nice natural
shape. Having the wolf alongside is a nice touch, as it all the sculpted leaves on the base. This is definitely one of
my favorite sculpts of the box.

## Roundup

Initially the leather and wood were hard to tell apart, but using the different shades of brown to highlight each
really separated the two and looks natural. The brighter skull works well as the focal point, and the additional of the
wolf, painted a light grey, adds a nice bit of interest to what would otherwise be a pretty dark model.
