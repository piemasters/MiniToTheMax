> Wyverns are an endangered species of ornithosaur with snake-like necks and long tails that end in a venomous trident,

> snatch their prey and carry it off to their nest, not caring if it is a sheep or a man.

## Miniature Review

What's not to like about a dragon, or at least a dragon like creature? I would love to see it flying, but I get that's
not the most practical. Despite it being a bit squashed up to keep to the base, the pose of it crawling forward is
fairly unique and gives it a different feel. I do like that its curved one way rather than being uniform, as it gives
a lot of shape and texture to the wings and tail.

## Roundup

I was planning on doing a lot more with the skin, maybe adding in some blues or other subtle colors but in the end I
was so happy with how the red applied semi-transparently over the orange I didn't want to do anything to mess it up.

Once the black was finished I felt like the textures showed through well enough because of the slapchop that I didn't
really need any extra highlighting or colors.
