> Bruxa is a very powerful type of vampire that takes on the appearance of a dark-haired, young human, most often
> female, but whose natural form is that of a large, black bat with sharp fangs and claws. It is one of few vampire
> species not affected by sun, the others being alps, mulas and Higher Vampires.

## Miniature Review

The Bruxa has a great pose jumping from a large wooden post, giving it some height and a lot of forward movement.
Despite the vampire itself being fairly simple, which is fair as it often strikes from the shadows, the base adds
a lot of extra interest with the wheel and the barrel.

## Roundup

I had a lot of fun painting the base, but got a bit nervous painting the Bruxa as it's mostly all skin so I had to get
the lighting just right on it to look realistic and not be a bright purple and look silly. After the first coat I was
starting to panic, but adding a second layer of Shyish Purple to the shaded areas made a massive difference and really
pulled it back.
