> Ghouls and graveirs are hard to describe. In part, they resemble humans - yet on the whole, they are the utter
> negation of all that is human. Though they have arms and legs like men, they walk on all fours like dogs or badgers.
> Though they have eerily familiar faces, one searches them in vain for any sign of sentiment, reason or even a spark
> of consciousness. They are driven by one thing and one thing only: an insatiable craving for human flesh.

## Miniature Review

The ghoul has a great creepy pose, with bones jutting out from its back. The base really makes it, being covered in
bones and with an arm either crawling out or looking to pull a new victim into its lair.

## Painting Techniques

### Body

<Paint name={'Plaguebearer Flesh'} />

## Base

### Dirt

<Paint name={'Ratling Grime'} />

### Rocks

<Paint name={'Basilicanum Grey'} />

### Bones

<Paint name={'Aggaros Dunes'} />

### Body Parts

<Paint name={'Guilliman Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Plaguebearer Flesh'} />

### Rim

<Paint name={'Abaddon Black'} />

For all miniatures in the set I'm using a mix of GamersGrass tufts and flowers.
