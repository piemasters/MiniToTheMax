## Miniature Review

I remember the Noonwraiths from Witcher 1 fairly well looking like human spirits or corpses, while in Witcher 3 I'm sure
they made them look much more monster like. I think the sculpt matches the artwork well, being somewhere in-between the
two.

The biggest part of the miniature is the wedding dress, with lots of layers and folds giving adding some movement to
the piece. The body isn't too over the top, but the huge tongue sticking out really gives it that dangerous monster
feel.

## Painting Techniques

### Dress

<Paint name={'Guilliman Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Flayed One Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Wrack White'} />

### Body

<Paint name={'Skeleton Horde'} />
<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />

### Hair

<Paint name={'Nazdreg Yellow'} />

### Wreath

<Paint name={'Militarum Green'} />

### Tongue

<Paint name={'Volupus Pink'} />

## Base

### Dirt

<Paint name={'Ratling Grime'} />

### Rim

<Paint name={'Abaddon Black'} />

For all miniatures in the set I'm using a mix of GamersGrass tufts and flowers.

## Roundup

I wasn't fully sure what colors to use for the dress. I wanted a pale pink or peach but don't really have any colors
like that, so ended up going with what I thought was closest, being a watered down skin tone. I then did a lot of
drybrushing to make it a lot more pale and closer to white. I'm not sure how great the shadows look on close inspection,
but from a distance I'm happy with how it came out.

I wasn't sure if I should go for a different skin tone to make the body stand out more from the dress, but in the end I
just went with a light bone color and I think it's worked well, resulting in a pale golden look, just how I remember
them from the games.
