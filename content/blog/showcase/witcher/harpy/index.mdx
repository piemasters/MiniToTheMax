## Miniature Review

The Harpy has been given a nice wide pose with its wings fully spread. It's also been given a good amount of height
with its leg fully extended from a rock, so it doesn't look out of place around some of the bigger monsters. I would
have like a bit more detail around the face, not that they have a lot in the artwork or game, but as a focal point I
don't feel like there's a lot to work with.

## Roundup

I went with a similar scheme to the Bruxa to keep it fairly simple. I did plan to add some turquoise and other shades
of green, blue and purple in to resemble the sea, but I didn't want to go too far and make it bright and multi-colored
so left it as is for now. I made it paler than the Bruxa to differentiate it, and with a sea base I think it works well
enough.
