> Fiends are walking mountains of muscle capped with horned, tooth-filled heads. Like their rarer cousins,
> bumbakvetches, they live in thick forests, swamps and bogs. When possible they avoid humans, but when not possible,
> they kill them, and without much difficulty.

## Miniature Review

When I see the Fiend I straight away think of the Bovine Defense Force Initiative in Witcher 3. People would farm
cows for coin early on in the game in White Orchard, so they added a patch where once you killed six cows a massive
high level monster would charge in and kill you. They even made a Bovine Defense Force gwent card with a Fiend on it,
although looking back at gameplay the monster was actually a Chort.

The Fiend is like a deer but huge, angry and with a third eye. The proportions of the miniature are spot on and the
anger in the face really makes it. Despite its bulk, the antlers give it some elegance and have been well sculpted.

For all miniatures in the set I'm using a mix of GamersGrass tufts and flowers.

## Roundup

This turned out to be a lot simpler than I expected based on its size. I'm really happy with the skin, the combination
of colors that I've never really used worked really well together. I hope I get a chance to use an even wider range of
colors as I go on as I'm finding real gems.
