## Miniature Review

I really enjoyed the Striga cinematic from Witcher 1, and it's one of the few scenes from the TV show that was done
fairly well. However, I'm not the biggest fan of this type of monster being a bit too bulky for the size for my liking.

However, I think they did a decent job of the sculpt and I much prefer the look of it having arms rather than four legs
that I've seen in some artwork. I also like the base, and wish more had something to stand on as it gives it more height
and a more dynamic pose.

## Roundup

I was really unhappy with it at the start. I wanted a lot lighter blue, but I wanted enough coverage that it wouldn't
look like a wash over white. I thought Stormfiend would be the right color, but it came out far too dark. When I tried
thinning it, it just applied patchy. In the end I had to go back to regular layering to salvage it, but it has created
a final result I'm fairly happy with.
