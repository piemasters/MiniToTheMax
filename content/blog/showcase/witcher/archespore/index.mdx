## Miniature Review

The Archespore is what I consider a bit more of a normal plant based monster compared to the Arachas. It's more of a
flower at the end of a vine that burrows through the ground and shots venom at its enemies.

Once again there is a lot of detail on the vine so a lot of opportunity to add some different colors for more interest
beyond just the flower.
