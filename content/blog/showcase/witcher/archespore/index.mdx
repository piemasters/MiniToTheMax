## Miniature Review

The Archespore is what I consider a bit more of a normal plant based monster compared to the Arachas. It's more of a
flower at the end of a vine that burrows through the ground and shots venom at its enemies.

Once again there is a lot of detail on the vine so a lot of opportunity to add some different colors for more interest
beyond just the flower.

## Painting Techniques

### Body

<Paint name={'Militarum Green'} />
<Paint name={'Garaghaks Sewer'} />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Briar Queen Chill'} />
<Paint name={'Nurgling Green'} />

### Petals

<Paint name={'Doomfire Magenta'} />

<Paint name={'Emperors Children'} />

### Spots

<Paint name={'Ironjawz Yellow'} />

For all miniatures in the set I'm using a mix of GamersGrass tufts and flowers.

## Roundup

I tried to keep a similar color scheme to the Arachas to tie them together, but added a couple of different colors
just so they don't look like the same species. The yellow goes well against the green and the darker vine wrapping
around gives it some contrast.

The flower maybe looks a bit flat, but I didn't want to make it too bright. Maybe I'll come back to it later on with
an extra spot highlight or two.
