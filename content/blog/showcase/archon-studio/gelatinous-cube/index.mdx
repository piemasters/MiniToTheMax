## Miniature Review

The cube is made from a green clear plastic, which gives it a great translucent effect but means you can't prime it,
making it a bit tricky to paint. I've seen it painted by covering it in Nurgle's Rot and it looked great, but I wanted
to keep it clear so you can see any miniature put inside. There's room for a 32mm scale model inside.

The cube looks great, having a really natural shape and the way the rocks and skeleton are sculpted into the sides
is great and works from multiple angles. It's got a few other details like a shield, a few arrows, a sword and spear
and some skulls that lets you add some color that gives the piece a lot more interest.

There's also a few bubbles sculpted into the sides and ooze dripping over the edges which adds to the overall effect,
stopping the cube from looking too flat.

## Painting Techniques

### Ooze

<Paint name={'Nurgles Rot'} />
<Paint name={'Striking Scorpion Green'} />

I only painted these colors into the recesses and onto the bubbles and drips to maintain the translucent effect
of the cube.

<Paint name={'Iron Hands Steel'} />
<Paint name={'Runefang Steel'} />

### Gold

<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Reikland Fleshshade Gloss'} />
<Paint name={'Liberator Gold'} />

### Rock

<Paint name={'Eshin Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Skavenblight Dinge'} />
<Paint name={'Nuln Oil'} />
<Paint name={'Dawnstone'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />

## Roundup

The cube came out looking pretty great, although it wasn't the easiest to paint. The biggest difficulty is there's
details on both sides of the cube, so the first color you put down on the inside is the only color seen through from
the other. This means you can't rely on shading and highlighting, you have to get the base color right first time.

I added some Nurgle's Rot to the patches of the cube to give it a slimy look, but not too much as I still wanted to see
inside clearly. It's not as slimy as it could be, but I think I got the balance about right.
