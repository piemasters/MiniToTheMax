## Miniature Review

What I really love about the Rascaltown range is how much character each of the goblins has and how well suited they
are to really vibrant colors. The face on this goblin has such a great expression with big eyes and a gigantic nose.
It's all very cute with the critters and (poor beat up fish!) and the cheeky bum of both the goblin and the frog
adds some fun to the rear.

## Painting Techniques

I wanted to make this guy as vibrant as possible as it's not something I've attempted before and most warhammer can
look very drab. To achieve this I went with the additional challenge of only using 6 paints, the Pro Acryl Rogue Hobbies
signature set of 6. This includes:

- Ultramarine
- Orange Red
- Bright Green
- Dark Turquoise
- Dark Hot Pink
- Bismuth Yellow

This gives you the classic red, green and blue primary colors traditionally used for painting, as well as a cyan,
magenta and yellow commonly used for printing. This combination allows the creation of more or less any color without
having to sacrifice vibrancy.

On top of these paints I did also use Black Legion from Games Workshop and White Star from Two Thin Coats, a white and
black to help with shadows and highlights. I tried to use these sparingly though, as they can quickly kill the vibrancy.

Beyond this I followed the youtube video that Louise includes a link to in the box that covers around half of the
miniature, making a few changes, then made up my own scheme for the remainder. I went through about 6 wet palette
sheets with all the mixing.

## Base

As you might have noticed the goblin is currently only bluetacked to the base. I was really happy with how I carved the
balsa wood into shape to create the fishing platform and created a nice sea floor. The rope holding it together turned
out a bit of a mess, but it made it look weathered so it wasn't the end of the world. Then I added the water effects..

A few lessons from that:

- Ensure what you hold the water effects in with is solid. The plastic I used warped and the shape of the water is
  very messy
- Apply thin layers, as I went with two thick layers it pulled towards the edges created a very warped surface. I
  used a craft knife to straighten it out to some extent, but it'll never look as flat and polished as it should.
- Ensure anything stuck to the base is fully secure. I had 2 grass tufts float to the top and are now impossible to
  remove.

And if all that wasn't enough I'm really not happy with how it's painted. I wanted it to look drag in contrast to the
goblin, but it feels like the two just don't live together in the same world. I think the brown needed to be much more
red and vibrant and it really needed a bank or something to add some nice vibrant grass and flowers or something.

## Roundup

Overall I'm really happy with how the goblin turned out. It's maybe the highest standard I've painted a miniature to
before and it really stands out on the shelf. I feel like I've let it down though with the base, so I plan to revisit
it in the future, ideally with much more vibrant flora and maybe some fun surrounding items.
