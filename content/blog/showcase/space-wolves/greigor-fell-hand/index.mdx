> Geigor Fell-Hand was known as a valiant warrior, but his command record was marred by a history of reversals on the
> battlefield. The worst of these was on the world of Droggorn, where the Space Wolves were fighting alongside the
> Thousand Sons against orks. The Thousand Sons retreated in what Geigor considered an act of cowardice and betrayal,
> resulting in the death of his entire pack.

I bought the Battle of Prospero boxset quite a while ago now. I cut out and filed down all the pieces ready for
assembly, but never got around to gluing anything together as I wanted to finish some other projects first before I
added another wall of grey plastic to my shelves. That is apart from Greigor.

## Miniature Review

Greigor is one of my favorite Space Wolf characters. They didn't go too over the top on him, he's still very much just
a marine, but he carries the same lightning claw as Bjorn, which was most likely meant for him. Being alive during the
Horus Heresy he also has an older pattern of armour, although well decorated which helps to match him in with a more
modern army.

The skull gives him the height needed to pick him out as a leader amongst a pack on the table and as always I really
like the movement in the charging pose, he looks ready to leap at him next target with a frost weapon ready in each
hand.

## Painting Techniques

### Armour
<Paint name={'The Fang'} />
<Paint name={'Russ Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Fenrisian Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Blue Horror'} />

Fenrisian Grey is applied as an edge highlight and Blue Horror as an extreme edge highlight.

### Pelts
<Paint name={'Karak Stone'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />

Ushabti Bone and Screaming Skull can be swapped out for Tyrant Skull and Terminatus Stone.
For fur apply the shade more heavily in the center.

### Bone & Fangs
<Paint name={'Morghast Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Rakarth Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />

Alternatively use Zandri Dust, Reikland Fleshshade and Screaming Skull for a slightly different look.

### Red Armour & Leather
<Paint name={'Khorne Red'} />
<Paint name={'Mephiston Red'} />
<Paint name={'Evil Sunz Scarlet'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Mephiston Red'} />
<Paint name={'Evil Sunz Scarlet'} />
<Paint name={'Wild Rider Red'} />

Brighter colours should be applied where the light would reflect the most, or parallel to edges when painting pack
markings on their shoulders.

### Runic Stone
<Paint name={'Mechanicus Standard Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Dawnstone'} />

### Runes & Lenses (Blue)
<Paint name={'Kantor Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Caledor Sky'} />
<Paint name={'Lothern Blue'} />
<Paint name={'White Scar'} />

### Lenses & Gems (Green)
<Paint name={'Warpstone Glow'} />
<Paint name={'Moot Green'} />
<Paint name={'Gauss Blaster Green'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

### Skin
<Paint name={'Bugmans Glow'} />
<Paint name={'Cadian Fleshtone'} />
<Paint name={'Reikland Fleshshade'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Carroburg Crimson'} />
<Paint name={'Kislev Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Pallid Wych Flesh'} />

Agrax Earthshade is thinned down and only applied to the deepest recesses.
Carroburg Crimson is applied in the recesses around the eyes and nose.

### Beige Hair
<Paint name={'Karak Stone'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />

### Steel
<Paint name={'Leadbelcher'} />
<Paint name={'Nuln Oil'} />
<Paint name={'Leadbelcher'} />
<Paint name={'Runefang Steel'} />
<Paint name={'Stormhost Silver'} />

### Power Weapons
<Paint name={'Kantor Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Caledor Sky'} />
<Paint name={'Alaitoc Blue'} />
<Paint name={'White Scar'} />

I broke each side of the sword down into quarters, painting the sharpest part of the blade white, then each part further
away a darker shade of blue. To blend each adjacent quarter I mixed the two paints together and applied it in the
middle. I then repeated this over and over, always saving a bit of each mixture, until achieving a smooth transition.
A final edge highlight of White Scar was applied.

For the plasma coil I also applied a wash of Drakenhof Nightshade after the base layer to create more of a contrast.
The brighter blues and white were focused on the raised areas and towards the center of the coil. This could be
reversed to create a different effect, with the inner coil being brighter showing the heat generated internally.

### Weapon Casings & Seals
<Paint name={'Corvus Black'} />
<Paint name={'Mechanicus Standard Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />

Mechanicus Standard Grey is applied as an edge highlight and Administratum Grey as an extreme edge highlight.

### Gold
<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Liberator Gold'} />
<Paint name={'Stormhost Silver'} />

### Cloth & Parchment
<Paint name={'Morghast Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Rakarth Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Seraphim Sepia'} />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />

### Purity Seals
<Paint name={'Khorne Red'} />
<Paint name={'Mephiston Red'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Mephiston Red'} />
<Paint name={'Evil Sunz Scarlet'} />

Screamer Pink, Emperor's Children and Nuln Oil can be used instead to differentiate from other reds.

### Leather
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Nuln Oil'} />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Tuskgor Fur'} />
<Paint name={'Baneblade Brown'} />

### Yellow Armour
<Paint name={'Averland Sunset'} />
<Paint name={'Yriel Yellow'} />
<Paint name={'Flash Gitz Yellow'} />

## Basing

I cast some Fantascape Glacial Ruins bases using Instant Mold & Milliput, then glued some sand around the edges,
applying a second layer of watered down PVA to help it stuck.

### Stone
<Paint name={'Karak Stone'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Karak Stone'} />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Seraphim Sepia'} />
<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />
<Paint name={'Pallid Wych Flesh'} />

The Seraphim Sepia was applied in patches to give a dirt stained look.

### Ice
<Paint name={'The Fang'} />
<Paint name={'Russ Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Fenrisian Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Etherium Blue'} />

### Dirt
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />

<Paint name={'Tallarn Sand'} />
<Paint name={'Zandri Dust'} />

### Base Edge
<Paint name={'Rhinox Hide'} />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />

Finally, I applied some Mordheim Turf tufts and then a couple of layers of Deluxe's Scenic Snow.

## Roundup

I was surprised to find just how much decoration and detail the miniature has, mainly focused around the legs and on the
frost claw arm. It means I was able to add a lot of colour, that goes nicely with the green gems that help to frame his
face. I think the power weapons will also help to identify him from others, as those claws really are unique. I'd really
like to see more unique styled weapons for heroes in the future!
