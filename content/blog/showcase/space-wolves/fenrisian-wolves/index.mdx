## Miniature Review

So I decided I just didn't have enough wolves yet, so to add the Thunderwolves I bought a box of Fenrisian Wolves.
I really like the movement in the unit and was surprised by the height of them, they're a lot bigger than the old
miniatures!

They're designed similarly to the Thunderwolves, just smaller and a lot skinnier. The only real detail beyond their fur
is around the face so that'll be where it's worth spending most of the effort when painting.

## Painting Techniques

#### Fur
<Paint name={'Zandri Dust'} />
<Paint name={'Seraphim Sepia'} />
<Paint name={'Reikland Fleshshade'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Karak Stone'} />
<Paint name={'Tyrant Skull'} />
<Paint name={'Bestigor Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Longbeard Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />

Only apply the Reikland Fleshshade to the top darker parts, and the Agrax Earthshade within that.
The Karak Stone is used to lightly highlight the darker areas, while the Tyrant Skull should only be used to highlight
the lighter areas.
The Bestigor Flesh was used to highlight the areas between light and dark to create a transition.
The Longbeard Grey and Screaming Skull is used to highlight areas such as the ears and lightest parts of the fur.

### Legs
<Paint name={'Karak Stone'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />

### Fangs
<Paint name={'Morghast Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Rakarth Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />

Alternatively use Zandri Dust, Reikland Fleshshade and Screaming Skull for a slightly different look.

### Eyes
<Paint name={'Kantor Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Caledor Sky'} />
<Paint name={'Lothern Blue'} />
<Paint name={'White Scar'} />

### Nose & Claws
<Paint name={'Corvus Black'} />
<Paint name={'Mechanicus Standard Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />

#### Gums
<Paint name={'Cadian Fleshtone'} />
<Paint name={'Carroburg Crimson'} />
<Paint name={'Emperors Children'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />

## Basing

I cast some Fantascape Glacial Ruins bases using Instant Mold & Milliput, then glued some sand around the edges,
applying a second layer of watered down PVA to help it stuck.

### Stone
<Paint name={'Karak Stone'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Karak Stone'} />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Seraphim Sepia'} />
<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />
<Paint name={'Pallid Wych Flesh'} />

The Seraphim Sepia was applied in patches to give a dirt stained look.

### Ice
<Paint name={'The Fang'} />
<Paint name={'Russ Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Fenrisian Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Etherium Blue'} />

### Dirt
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Tallarn Sand'} />
<Paint name={'Zandri Dust'} />

### Base Edge
<Paint name={'Rhinox Hide'} />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />

Finally, I applied some Mordheim Turf tufts and then a couple of layers of Deluxe's Scenic Snow.

## Roundup

These guys were super quick to paint, it's amazing what a difference not having edge highlighting makes. I think having
the blue eyes really adds some contrast to them and draws your eye to the faces. I l;ike how the mouth and gums came
out as well, asd I've struggled with getting the colour to look natural in the past.

Ok I think for now I've added enough wolves, maybe i should paint something a bit different next?
