> From the Mountains of the Maelstrom come the legendary Thunderwolves, hulking beasts with jaws so strong they can
> chew through steel. There are several known instances of senior Space Wolves tracking down and ‘breaking in’
> Thunderwolves, and this practice, thought to be an initiation ritual into the upper echelons of the Wolf Guard, has
> given rise to the near-mythical Thunderwolf Cavalry - a small but dauntless elite within the ranks of the Wolf Guard
> who remain absent from any official Imperial records.

## Miniature Review

Having painted the first full unit I wanted to move away from infantry and paint something truly Space Wolfy, and what's
more wolfy than giant wolves?

As they're quite large miniatures I drilled holes into their feet and attached cut down paperclips into the base, so
they slot on and can easily be removed for transportation. I also magnetised the legs to each wolf, so the riders can be
removed. I did the same with the bodies, so I can swap out the weapon options in the future if I want to.

It was fun building bases that matched their poses as there's a lot of movement in the wolves, and I wanted to give the
more dynamic poses some height as they leap forwards. I also wanted to have each marine holding on with their shield
arm, while holding their weapon high as part of the charge.

The cyber parts of the wolves such as the bionic leg and eye also adds some fun futuristic detail without going too far.

## Painting Techniques

### Armour
<Paint name={'The Fang'} />
<Paint name={'Russ Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Fenrisian Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Blue Horror'} />

Fenrisian Grey is applied as an edge highlight and Blue Horror as an extreme edge highlight.

### Pelts
<Paint name={'Karak Stone'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />

Ushabti Bone and Screaming Skull can be swapped out for Tyrant Skull and Terminatus Stone.
For fur apply the shade more heavily in the center.

### Bone & Fangs
<Paint name={'Morghast Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Rakarth Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />

Alternatively use Zandri Dust, Reikland Fleshshade and Screaming Skull for a slightly different look.

### Red Armour & Leather
<Paint name={'Khorne Red'} />
<Paint name={'Mephiston Red'} />
<Paint name={'Evil Sunz Scarlet'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Mephiston Red'} />
<Paint name={'Evil Sunz Scarlet'} />
<Paint name={'Wild Rider Red'} />

Brighter colours should be applied where the light would reflect the most, or parallel to edges when painting pack
markings on their shoulders.

### Runic Stone
<Paint name={'Mechanicus Standard Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Dawnstone'} />

### Runes & Lenses (Blue)
<Paint name={'Kantor Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Caledor Sky'} />
<Paint name={'Lothern Blue'} />
<Paint name={'White Scar'} />

### Lenses & Gems (Green)
<Paint name={'Warpstone Glow'} />
<Paint name={'Moot Green'} />
<Paint name={'Gauss Blaster Green'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

### Skin
<Paint name={'Bugmans Glow'} />
<Paint name={'Cadian Fleshtone'} />
<Paint name={'Reikland Fleshshade'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Carroburg Crimson'} />
<Paint name={'Kislev Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Pallid Wych Flesh'} />

Agrax Earthshade is thinned down and only applied to the deepest recesses.
Carroburg Crimson is applied in the recesses around the eyes and nose.

### Beige Hair
<Paint name={'Karak Stone'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />

### Steel
<Paint name={'Leadbelcher'} />
<Paint name={'Nuln Oil'} />
<Paint name={'Leadbelcher'} />
<Paint name={'Runefang Steel'} />
<Paint name={'Stormhost Silver'} />

### Power Weapons
<Paint name={'Kantor Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Caledor Sky'} />
<Paint name={'Alaitoc Blue'} />
<Paint name={'White Scar'} />

The sword was painted by treating each half as opposites. On the left side the white is at the top, and the darkest blue
is on the bottom, while on the right side this is reversed. I then broke down each side into quarters, painting each
with their respective colour. For the other weapons I painted the darkest blue at the base of the weapon, with the white
along the edge of the blade or hammer.

To blend each adjacent quarter I mixed the two paints together and applied it in the middle. I then repeated this over
and over, always saving a bit of each mixture, until achieving a smooth transition. A final edge highlight of White
Scar was applied.

For the plasma coil I also applied a wash of Drakenhof Nightshade after the base layer to create more of a contrast.
The brighter blues and white were focused on the raised areas and towards the center of the coil. This could be
reversed to create a different effect, with the inner coil being brighter showing the heat generated internally.

### Weapon Casings & Seals
<Paint name={'Corvus Black'} />
<Paint name={'Mechanicus Standard Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />

Mechanicus Standard Grey is applied as an edge highlight and Administratum Grey as an extreme edge highlight.

### Gold
<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Liberator Gold'} />
<Paint name={'Stormhost Silver'} />

### Cloth & Parchment
<Paint name={'Morghast Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Rakarth Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Seraphim Sepia'} />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />

### Purity Seals
<Paint name={'Khorne Red'} />
<Paint name={'Mephiston Red'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Mephiston Red'} />
<Paint name={'Evil Sunz Scarlet'} />

Screamer Pink, Emperor's Children and Nuln Oil can be used instead to differentiate from other reds.

### Leather
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Nuln Oil'} />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Tuskgor Fur'} />

<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />

Only apply the Reikland Fleshshade to the top darker parts, and the Agrax Earthshade within that.
The Karak Stone is used to lightly highlight the darker areas, while the Tyrant Skull should only be used to highlight
the lighter areas.

I cast some Fantascape Glacial Ruins bases using Instant Mold & Milliput, then glued some sand around the edges,
applying a second layer of watered down PVA to help it stuck.

Finally, I applied some Mordheim Turf tufts and then a couple of layers of Deluxe's Scenic Snow.

## Roundup

Painting the thunderwolves was really quick and fun, good for breaking up painting power armour and especially blending
power weapons. I ended up painting their noses in the same way as human flesh, but I might make them black in the future
as they don't look quite right after some reflection.

I tried to drybrush some of the highlighting on the armour, but I don't really like the effect. I might go back over
it at some point, but for now I want to keep moving and start on the next unit!
