> assigned to a dangerous mission that demands speed and daring, such as navigating a treacherous stretch of land in
> pursuit of a hated enemy, or to rescue a lost chapter relic ahead of a closing enemy force.

## Miniature Review

So I'm not sure where I got these guys from, but I've had them for a while. The bikes themselves I think were just a
generic Space Marine kit, so I had some fun kit-bashing with all my Space Wolves odds and ends, and they don't look
half bad.

I prefer the bulkier look of the new Primaris bikes, but I think with these the marines become the real stars.
Similarly to the Thunderwolves I positioned most of them with their weapons held high on the charge. They're well
kitted out, and so they should be as I painted them with the yellow of the Wolf Guard.

## Painting Techniques

### Armour
<Paint name={'The Fang'} />
<Paint name={'Russ Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Fenrisian Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Blue Horror'} />

Fenrisian Grey is applied as an edge highlight and Blue Horror as an extreme edge highlight.

### Pelts
<Paint name={'Karak Stone'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />

Ushabti Bone and Screaming Skull can be swapped out for Tyrant Skull and Terminatus Stone.
For fur apply the shade more heavily in the center.

### Bone & Fangs
<Paint name={'Morghast Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Rakarth Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />

Alternatively use Zandri Dust, Reikland Fleshshade and Screaming Skull for a slightly different look.

### Red Armour & Leather
<Paint name={'Khorne Red'} />
<Paint name={'Mephiston Red'} />
<Paint name={'Evil Sunz Scarlet'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Mephiston Red'} />
<Paint name={'Evil Sunz Scarlet'} />
<Paint name={'Wild Rider Red'} />

Brighter colours should be applied where the light would reflect the most, or parallel to edges when painting pack
markings on their shoulders.

### Runic Stone
<Paint name={'Mechanicus Standard Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Dawnstone'} />

### Runes & Lenses (Blue)
<Paint name={'Kantor Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Caledor Sky'} />
<Paint name={'Lothern Blue'} />
<Paint name={'White Scar'} />

### Lenses & Gems (Green)
<Paint name={'Warpstone Glow'} />
<Paint name={'Moot Green'} />
<Paint name={'Gauss Blaster Green'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

### Skin
<Paint name={'Bugmans Glow'} />
<Paint name={'Cadian Fleshtone'} />
<Paint name={'Reikland Fleshshade'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Carroburg Crimson'} />
<Paint name={'Kislev Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Pallid Wych Flesh'} />

Agrax Earthshade is thinned down and only applied to the deepest recesses.
Carroburg Crimson is applied in the recesses around the eyes and nose.

### Beige Hair
<Paint name={'Karak Stone'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />

### Steel
<Paint name={'Leadbelcher'} />
<Paint name={'Nuln Oil'} />
<Paint name={'Leadbelcher'} />
<Paint name={'Runefang Steel'} />
<Paint name={'Stormhost Silver'} />

### Power Weapons
<Paint name={'Kantor Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Caledor Sky'} />
<Paint name={'Alaitoc Blue'} />
<Paint name={'White Scar'} />

The axe and hammer were painted in quarters, with the base of the weapons painted the darkest blue, with white at the
end of each weapon. To blend each adjacent quarter I mixed the two paints together and applied it in the middle. I then
repeated this over and over, always saving a bit of each mixture, until achieving a smooth transition. A final edge
highlight of White Scar was applied.

### Weapon Casings, Seals, Tyres and Seats
<Paint name={'Corvus Black'} />
<Paint name={'Mechanicus Standard Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />

Mechanicus Standard Grey is applied as an edge highlight and Administratum Grey as an extreme edge highlight.

### Gold
<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Liberator Gold'} />
<Paint name={'Stormhost Silver'} />

### Cloth & Parchment
<Paint name={'Morghast Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Rakarth Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Seraphim Sepia'} />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />

### Purity Seals
<Paint name={'Khorne Red'} />
<Paint name={'Mephiston Red'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Mephiston Red'} />
<Paint name={'Evil Sunz Scarlet'} />

Screamer Pink, Emperor's Children and Nuln Oil can be used instead to differentiate from other reds.

### Leather
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Nuln Oil'} />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Tuskgor Fur'} />
<Paint name={'Baneblade Brown'} />

### Yellow Armour
<Paint name={'Averland Sunset'} />
<Paint name={'Yriel Yellow'} />
<Paint name={'Flash Gitz Yellow'} />

## Basing

I cast some Fantascape Glacial Ruins bases using Instant Mold & Milliput, then glued some sand around the edges,
applying a second layer of watered down PVA to help it stuck.

### Stone
<Paint name={'Karak Stone'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Karak Stone'} />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Seraphim Sepia'} />
<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />
<Paint name={'Pallid Wych Flesh'} />

The Seraphim Sepia was applied in patches to give a dirt stained look.

### Ice
<Paint name={'The Fang'} />
<Paint name={'Russ Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Fenrisian Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Etherium Blue'} />

### Dirt
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Tallarn Sand'} />
<Paint name={'Zandri Dust'} />

### Base Edge
<Paint name={'Rhinox Hide'} />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />

Finally, I applied some Mordheim Turf tufts and then a couple of layers of Deluxe's Scenic Snow.

## Roundup

I don't plan to add many vehicles to the army, so it's nice to add this unit now just so there's a bit of
representation there. Having some more Fast Attack options is also nice.

I used some weathering powers and went a bit heavier on the washes to create a dirtier look, as they would be travelling
at speed through varied terrain. This helped to hide a few mistakes and tone down the bikes a bit, so the marines stay
in focus.

I also tried adding a few basic patterns to the bikes to break up the flat areas. I wasn't the happiest with the
results, but it should be easy enough to touch up in the future. I think they either need to be thicker, or I need to
add a bit of colour to them.
