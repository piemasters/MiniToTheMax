> The Sorcerer has left the tower on a mysterious errand so his Familiars are taking the opportunity to have a
> frenzied magical fight!

This board game was created by Jordan Sorcery, with the miniatures sculpted by Gary Morley and the artwork created by
Becka Moor.

## Miniature Review

First off the miniatures are fantastic. Each familiar has a fairly simple sculpt, but there is so much character and
personality. The details are crisp and clean, making them simple and a joy to paint.

Hartha Mank (the mouse) is my favorite model of the set. I love the face and the combination of the wizard hat and the
cloak makes him look like a proper little sorcerer. His small little hands grasping the magic orb creates a secondary
focal point and adds a level of cuteness.

Luune (the moon) is my next favorite and is the closest to what I think of when I think of 80/90s Games Workshop
familiars. The shape of the face is really nice and I love the outfit. The pose is maybe a little stiff, but the
ninja stars more than make up for it.

Talis is a toad and that would normally be a automatic pass to the top spot for me. He's great and I love the face,
but he's lacking the detail compared to the two above. Maybe a wizard hat or another accessory would have helped.

Finally, we have Wooden Tony (the broom) who is a fun little model. The broomstick is nicely detailed and once again
I love the face. He has fairly hench arms that adds some fun, but I can't help but keep seeing him as a Peperami.

## Board Art Review

The board is nice and small which I like, as a fairly simpl game with small miniatures I'm glad it doesn't take up
too much space. The art style is very much in line with the miniatures and has a nice cartoonish style. The colors
are super vibrant that adds to the fun feel of the game, as do the cute characters and tentacles.

I ended up creating a custom spell book token to go along with the game, as the original was too flat and small for my
liking. I painted it to match the design included with the rules using colors I used on the miniatures.

I also decided to create a 3D board rather than just printing it out on paper or thin card. I cut out mdf squares, then
added a layer of cork board on top to give it a bit of height. I then added a very thin layer of cork board around the
outside to match the print out borders to again give the edges of the board a bit of height. I then printed the board
onto regular paper and glued it to the top of the cork board and once dry applied a matt varnish. Finally I painted the
edges of the board black to give it a nice finish and the inner edges purple to match the board design.

## Game Review

The game itself is very simple. The game is made up of 8 turns, and each turn each players gets two actions, move and
casting a spell. The objective is to collect magical energy (dice) by casting a magic bolt at the other familiars.
Once you have enough energy if you have the spell book you can attempt to cast a big spell to win the game, but if you
fail you lose a point of energy and the spell book.

It's a quick game and can become a bit of a pile up but it's a lot of fun. The randomness of the dice rolls means that
anyone can catch up to win, especially if people gang up on whoever is in the lead. I think it's a great game to play
with kids as it's nice and simple, but I would want to add a few house rules to make it a bit more strategic for adults.

I think rolls of a 1 should cause a misfire, and you shouldn't be able to target a familiar that is next to you. This
would add a bit more strategy to the game. Having the pushback effect of the magic bolt increase based on how much
energy you have or how much extra you roll over the target number would also be a good idea. It'd also be fun to add
some extra spells to the familiars and ideally have a unique spell for each familiar.

### Bases

- [Rolling Pin Temple](https://www.greenstuffworld.com/en/modelling-textured-rolling-pins/365-rolling-pin-hobby-roller-temple.html)
- [Silicone Guide Rings](https://www.greenstuffworld.com/en/modelling-textured-rolling-pins/540-silicone-guide-rings.html)
- [Sculptor Vaseline](https://www.greenstuffworld.com/en/sculptor-vaseline/349-sculptor-vaseline-petroleum-jelly.html)
- [Round Cutters for Bases](https://www.greenstuffworld.com/en/hobby-cutting-tools/801-round-cutters-for-bases-stainless-steel.html)

To create the base I applied the vaseline to the rolling pin and worktop, then used the rolling pin on the milliput to
create a large area of stone flooring. Doing a large batch with all the miniatures cut off their bases, I used the round
cutters to cut the perfect size for each, then pushed them flat onto each base while wet to create a strong bond and
ensure they went on flat.

The Scratch Brush Pens can be used to clean the rolling pin, to ensure detail isn't lost for its next use.

Once dry I sprayed them all black then applied the following colors:

<Paint name={'Xereus Purple'} />
<Paint name={'Thousand Sons Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Genestealer Purple'} />
<Paint name={'Dechala Lilac'} />

## Roundup

I buy a lot of miniatures and they can end up on my backlog for years. To avoid this I decided to really focus and
get the whole project completed within a few days, starting as soon as they arrived. They came on a Wednesday and
everything was done by Friday evening, which was a great feeling of accomplishment.

It would have been nice to have spent a bit longer on it, especially the board as it looks a bit rough, but I'm super
glad that I got it all done quickly and have had a chance to enjoy a few games already.

Overall this is a fantastic little game with great miniatures I would highly recommend picking it up, especially if
you enjoy Jordan Sorcery's content online.
