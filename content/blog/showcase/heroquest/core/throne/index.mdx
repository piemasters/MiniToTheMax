## Miniature Review

The thrones are very regal, but quite small. More of a fancy chair than a throne, but maybe I'm just comparing to
things like the Iron Throne from Game of Thrones. Some of the metal sculpture around the throne is nice, but feels
very low resolution and needed to be a lot sharper.

## Painting Techniques

### Wood

<Paint name={'Dryad Bark'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'XV88'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Baneblade Brown'} />

I airbrushed a few different tones of brown, finishing with a brighter color than desired so the following wash
would both apply shadow to the wood grain and bring the overall brightness down to the desired finish.
Finally I gave it a light drybrush to help further emphasis the grain of the wood.

### Gold

<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Liberator Gold'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Knights Steel'} />

### Cloth

<Paint name={'Blood Angels Red'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Evil Sunz Scarlet'} />

### Gem

<Paint name={'Teclis Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Baharroth Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

## Base

No base!

## Roundup

The red and gold looks really nice together, and the blue gem gives it a bright spot of color for a bit more interest.
I wish the shade brought more detail out on the gold trim, but the cast really let it down.
