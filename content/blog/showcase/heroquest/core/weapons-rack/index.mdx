## Miniature Review

There's a good number and variety of weapons on this rack! It's fairly simple with not a ton of sculpted detail,
but with the mix of sizes and arrangement of the shields at either side and the longer spear in the middle it looks ok.

## Painting Techniques

### Wood

<Paint name={'Dryad Bark'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'XV88'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Baneblade Brown'} />

I airbrushed a few different tones of brown, finishing with a brighter color than desired so the following wash
would both apply shadow to the wood grain and bring the overall brightness down to the desired finish.
Finally I gave it a light drybrush to help further emphasis the grain of the wood.

### Gold

<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Liberator Gold'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Knights Steel'} />
<Paint name={'Nihilakh Oxide'} />

### Bronze

<Paint name={'Brass Scorpion'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Sycorax Bronze'} />
<Paint name={'Nihilakh Oxide'} />

### Steel

<Paint name={'Iron Hands Steel'} />
<Paint name={'Space Wolves Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Knights Steel'} />

### Leather

<Paint name={'Black Legion'} />
<Paint name={'Thunderhawk Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Russ Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Fenrisian Grey'} />

## Base

No base!

## Roundup

There wasn't much detail to work with so it all looks a bit smooth. I wanted to keep consistency with the material of
all the weapons but ido wonder if it would have looked better with a bit more variety.
