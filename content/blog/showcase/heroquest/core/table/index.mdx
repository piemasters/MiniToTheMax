## Miniature Review

Compared to the other tables these are very plain, but they do match fairly well with the tables in the original game.
They do have a small amount of detail on the feet, but that's about it.

## Painting Techniques

### Wood

<Paint name={'Dryad Bark'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'XV88'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Baneblade Brown'} />

I airbrushed a few different tones of brown, finishing with a brighter color than desired so the following wash
would both apply shadow to the wood grain and bring the overall brightness down to the desired finish.
Finally I gave it a light drybrush to help further emphasis the grain of the wood.

### Gold

<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Liberator Gold'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Knights Steel'} />

## Base

No base!

## Roundup

These were very quick to paint up with only a couple of colors. I did wonder if these would look better with a black
steel rather than gold, but I wanted to keep everything in the same theme.
