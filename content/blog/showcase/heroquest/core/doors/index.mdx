## Miniature Review

I'm glad there's not too much detail on the doors as there is an awful lot of them! That being said there are a few
nice additions on top of the stonework. The keystone adds an opportunity for more color, as do the climbing vines on
either side.

## Painting Techniques

### Stone

<Paint name={'Dawnstone'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Praxeti White'} type={'dry'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />

I airbrushed a couple of grey tones, then gave it a light drybrush of white to over highlight it, ready for the
following wash to knock it back down. I then gave it a final gray highlight to bring everything together.

### Wood

<Paint name={'Dryad Bark'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'XV88'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Baneblade Brown'} />

I airbrushed a few different tones of brown, finishing with a brighter color than desired so the following wash
would both apply shadow to the wood grain and bring the overall brightness down to the desired finish.
Finally I gave it a light drybrush to help further emphasis the grain of the wood.

### Gold

<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Liberator Gold'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Knights Steel'} />

### Vines (Brown)

### Vines (Green)

## Base

No bases but I did use Forge World weathering powders to add dirt around the doors and did add a few random grass
tufts to add a bit of variety.

## Roundup

Initially I painted the keystones they same as the stone but they looked a bit too plain, so I repainted them gold
and it really helped give them a bit more interest and link the closed doors better with the open ones.
