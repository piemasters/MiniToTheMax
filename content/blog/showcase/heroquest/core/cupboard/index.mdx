## Miniature Review

The metallic detail, or potentially wood carvings, gives a bit of visual interest to a fairly simple piece. Having a
few simple pieces is actually a good thing, as having a lot of highly detailed furniture can draw too much attention
away from the heroes.

## Painting Techniques

### Wood

<Paint name={'Dryad Bark'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'XV88'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Baneblade Brown'} />

I airbrushed a few different tones of brown, finishing with a brighter color than desired so the following wash
would both apply shadow to the wood grain and bring the overall brightness down to the desired finish.
Finally I gave it a light drybrush to help further emphasis the grain of the wood.

### Gold

<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Liberator Gold'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Knights Steel'} />

## Base

No base!

## Roundup

I didn't get the wood tone quite right on this one, but it does give a bit of variety to the scenery rather than
everything being made from the eact same wood.
