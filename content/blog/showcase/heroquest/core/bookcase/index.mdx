## Miniature Review

The bookcase is fairly simple, but does contain an awful lot of books! There's also a bit of space to add some skulls or
rats included in the box. The wood grain is done fairly well over the piece which is great as it means it looks good
from both sides when it's on the board.

## Painting Techniques

### Wood

<Paint name={'Dryad Bark'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'XV88'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Baneblade Brown'} />

I airbrushed a few different tones of brown, finishing with a brighter color than desired so the following wash
would both apply shadow to the wood grain and bring the overall brightness down to the desired finish.
Finally I gave it a light drybrush to help further emphasis the grain of the wood.

### Gold

<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Liberator Gold'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Knights Steel'} />

### Steel

<Paint name={'Iron Hands Steel'} />
<Paint name={'Space Wolves Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Knights Steel'} />

### Books

I used a mix of different colors for the books, applying an Agrax Earthshade wash after the base coat. I then applied
highlight to each, focusing on the edges helping to contrast the covers for the paper.

### Paper

<Paint name={'Morghast Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Pallid Wych Flesh'} />

### Bone

<Paint name={'Morghast Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Pallid Wych Flesh'} />

## Base

No base!

## Roundup

I painted the books fairly simply as there was a lot of them and I don't want to spend forever on these. I may have
gone a bit heavy on the wash in a few areas, mostly where gravity has pulled it down before it's dried, so need to be
a bit more careful of that in the future.
