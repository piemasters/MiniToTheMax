## Miniature Review

The wood grain is really great on these chests, meaning they look fine with the rest of the detail being fairly simple.
It's a nice touch fitting the keyhole slot into the face of the monster, and could easily be painted as a face rather
than metal.

## Painting Techniques

### Wood

<Paint name={'Dryad Bark'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'XV88'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Baneblade Brown'} />

I airbrushed a few different tones of brown, finishing with a brighter color than desired so the following wash
would both apply shadow to the wood grain and bring the overall brightness down to the desired finish.
Finally I gave it a light drybrush to help further emphasis the grain of the wood.

### Gold

<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />

## Base

No base!

## Roundup

These chests are fairly plain but are neat and fit in nicely with the rest of the scenery pieces.
