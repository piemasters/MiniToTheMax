## Miniature Review

The inclusion of an empty frame is great and I've seen people fill it in with all kinds of photos and freehand
paintings. The fire itself is good, and the decoration around the outside of it is really nice giving it a really
grand look.

## Painting Techniques

### Wood

<Paint name={'Dryad Bark'} />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Baneblade Brown'} />

### Stone

<Paint name={'Dawnstone'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Praxeti White'} type={'dry'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />

I airbrushed a couple of grey tones, then gave it a light drybrush of white to over highlight it, ready for the
following wash to knock it back down. I then gave it a final gray highlight to bring everything together.

### Gold

<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Liberator Gold'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Knights Steel'} />

### Steel

<Paint name={'Iron Hands Steel'} />
<Paint name={'Space Wolves Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Knights Steel'} />

### Fire

<Paint name={'Bad Moon Yellow'} />
<Paint name={'Iyanden Yellow'} />
<Paint name={'Magmadroth Flame'} />
<Paint name={'Baal Red'} />
<Paint name={'Flesh Tearers Red'} />
<Paint name={'Abaddon Black'} />

As well as painting the flames, I used the same colors in the surrounding area for OSL.

### Painting

The painting is a photo of my dog that I added armour to, then cut out and stuck within the frame. As it looked a bit
too neat I painted a blue background around him to help blend the print with the paint, then applied a thin wash of
Agrax Earthshade over the top to give it an aged look.

## Base

No base!

## Roundup

I'm really happy with how the OSL effect came out and the fire itself looks pretty realistic. The painting of my dog
as a knight also came out great and makes me smile whenever I spot it on the table.
