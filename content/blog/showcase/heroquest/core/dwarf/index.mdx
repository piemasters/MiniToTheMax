## Miniature Review

I think I prefer the older pose of the stout dwarf standing proud, but this is still a great sculpt. It's much more
ferocious and dynamic with some great long flowing hair and beard. There are still some callbacks to the original
and he feels much larger and imposing.

To create the base I applied the vaseline to the rolling pin and worktop, then used the rolling pin on the milliput to
create a large area of stone flooring. Doing a large batch with all the miniatures cut off their bases, I used the round
cutters to cut the perfect size for each, then pushed them flat onto each base while wet to create a strong bond and
ensure they went on flat.

The Scratch Brush Pens can be used to clean the rolling pin, to ensure detail isn't lost for its next use.

Once dry I sprayed them all black then applied the following colors:

<Paint name={'Dawnstone'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Praxeti White'} type={'dry'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Gutrippa Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />

The Gutrippa Flesh was applied in the recesses and in some patches to resemble moss. Once painting was finished I went
over those areas with the grass flock to finish them off.

Note if you try to glue a miniature to a completed base the bond will be very weak due to paint peeling away from the
milliput very easily. You need to scratch away some of the paint from the base where they join to ensure a strong bond.

## Roundup

I found it quite hard to pick out the details before putting paint to the miniature and after the first base coat I
really wasn't sure with how it was turning out. After getting the detail on the hair right it all started to come
together and now overall I'm pretty happy with the final result. The real focus on the miniature is the face and axe
an I think both came out ok.
