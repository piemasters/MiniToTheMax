## Miniature Review

The new sculpt does a great job of building from the original. The overall pose is very similar with the sword held
aloft in the same position, but is less static and has a stronger sense of the strength of the hero. The proportions
of the body and head are also more realistic and he has a tactical rock as every hero must!

To create the base I applied the vaseline to the rolling pin and worktop, then used the rolling pin on the milliput to
create a large area of stone flooring. Doing a large batch with all the miniatures cut off their bases, I used the round
cutters to cut the perfect size for each, then pushed them flat onto each base while wet to create a strong bond and
ensure they went on flat.

The Scratch Brush Pens can be used to clean the rolling pin, to ensure detail isn't lost for its next use.

Once dry I sprayed them all black then applied the following colors:

<Paint name={'Dawnstone'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Praxeti White'} type={'dry'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Gutrippa Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />

The Gutrippa Flesh was applied in the recesses and in some patches to resemble moss. Once painting was finished I went
over those areas with the grass flock to finish them off.

Note if you try to glue a miniature to a completed base the bond will be very weak due to paint peeling away from the
milliput very easily. You need to scratch away some of the paint from the base where they join to ensure a strong bond.

## Roundup

Looking at the photos there's a lot of shine on the miniature that doesn't really come across when you see it in person.
At some point I'll varnish them all so hopefully that will fix it for future photos.

I have to admit I'm not the happiest with how it came out. I think the face and the skin aren't quite right, but I
don't want to keep adding to it and make it worse. It's a shame as it should be the standout piece of the set, but I
can always strip and repaint it in the future if I'm not happy with it. With that said I am happy with the overall
colorscheme.
