## Miniature Review

The Sorcerer's Table has some nice detail on the top, although I'm not fully sure if the intention is for it to be
made of stone or another material. The main focus though is the book. It'd be great to have some detail sculpted into
the pages, but being flat does allow for freehand or transfers.

## Painting Techniques

### Stone

<Paint name={'Dawnstone'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Praxeti White'} type={'dry'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />

I airbrushed a couple of grey tones, then gave it a light drybrush of white to over highlight it, ready for the
following wash to knock it back down. I then gave it a final gray highlight to bring everything together.

### Wood

<Paint name={'Dryad Bark'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'XV88'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Baneblade Brown'} />

I airbrushed a few different tones of brown, finishing with a brighter color than desired so the following wash
would both apply shadow to the wood grain and bring the overall brightness down to the desired finish.
Finally I gave it a light drybrush to help further emphasis the grain of the wood.

### Steel

<Paint name={'Iron Hands Steel'} />
<Paint name={'Space Wolves Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Knights Steel'} />

### Gold

<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Liberator Gold'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Knights Steel'} />

### Paper

<Paint name={'Morghast Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Pallid Wych Flesh'} />

Once the paper was painted I then applied a number of different transfers to resemble text and drawings.

### Red Cloth

<Paint name={'Mephiston Red'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Mephiston Red'} />
<Paint name={'Evil Sunz Scarlet'} />

### Wax

<Paint name={'Corax White'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

### Flame

<Paint name={'Iyanden Yellow'} />
<Paint name={'Phalanx Yellow'} />

## Base

No base!

## Roundup

The transfers came out looking pretty great. The text might be a bit easier to read and more realistic if the paper was
highlighted up a bit, as the text isn't weathered to match the paper. It's still a lot better than anything I could
have freehanded though!
