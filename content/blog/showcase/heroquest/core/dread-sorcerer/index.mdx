## Miniature Review

The dread sorcerer seems to be the big bad guy for the core box. The sculpt itself is fine, but I would hope for
something a bit more intimidating as the major villain. The robes and pose give him the look of a strong magic user,
but he looks very fragile and I expect the heroes to break him apart with ease.

## Painting Techniques

### Robes

<Paint name={'Leviathan Purple'} />
<Paint name={'Magos Purple'} />
<Paint name={'Sigvald Burgundy'} />
<Paint name={'Druchii Violet'} />

Leviathan Purple' was used for the main part of the outer robe, with Magos Purple used for the lighter hemming.
Sigvald Burgundy was used for the inner robe.
Druchii Violet was applied thinly in a few areas to add a bit more contrast.

### Steel

<Paint name={'Iron Hands Steel'} />
<Paint name={'Space Wolves Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Knights Steel'} />

### Gold

<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Liberator Gold'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Knights Steel'} />

### Flesh

<Paint name={'Skeleton Horde'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Pallid Wych Flesh'} />

### Eyes

<Paint name={'Talassar Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

### Wood

<Paint name={'Wyldwood'} />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Baneblade Brown'} />

To create the base I applied the vaseline to the rolling pin and worktop, then used the rolling pin on the milliput to
create a large area of stone flooring. Doing a large batch with all the miniatures cut off their bases, I used the round
cutters to cut the perfect size for each, then pushed them flat onto each base while wet to create a strong bond and
ensure they went on flat.

The Scratch Brush Pens can be used to clean the rolling pin, to ensure detail isn't lost for its next use.

Once dry I sprayed them all black then applied the following colors:

<Paint name={'Dawnstone'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Praxeti White'} type={'dry'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Gutrippa Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />

The Gutrippa Flesh was applied in the recesses and in some patches to resemble moss. Once painting was finished I went
over those areas with the grass flock to finish them off.

Note if you try to glue a miniature to a completed base the bond will be very weak due to paint peeling away from the
milliput very easily. You need to scratch away some of the paint from the base where they join to ensure a strong bond.

## Roundup

I wasn't fully sure what colorscheme I was really going for from the start other than I wanted to use a few different
purples. I'm not sure if the lighter purple fully works, and would maybe be better as gold, or potentially something
more neutral like white or black. Still, I'm fairly happy with him and I think he should stand out well on the board.
