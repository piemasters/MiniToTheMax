## Miniature Review

There's a lot of good detail on this miniature, the suit of armour and cloth laid on top surrounded by shields, the
pillars at the base with small details engraved and larger patterns between them. The only downside really is that
despite the top coming up to expose the interior, it's completely flat and empty inside. I'd have loved an insert or
a small amount of detail to fit a skeleton in there.

## Painting Techniques

### Stone

<Paint name={'Dawnstone'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Praxeti White'} category="Citadel Dry" />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />

I airbrushed a couple of grey tones, then gave it a light drybrush of white to over highlight it, ready for the
following wash to knock it back down. I then gave it a final gray highlight to bring everything together.

## Base

No base!

## Roundup

I wasn't sure whether to paint the cloth and armour the same as the base, the whole thing being sculpted from a single
piece of stone. However, I decided it would look too plain that way so decided the paint it as the suit of armour of
the warrior buried below. This gives it more color and a bit more story behind the piece.
