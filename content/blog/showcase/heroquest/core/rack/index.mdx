## Miniature Review

The torture rack is fairly simple but has a few dotted details such as the shackles, bone arm and torn cloth. The
crank is the standout feature though and gives the overall miniature a nice shape.

## Painting Techniques

### Stone

<Paint name={'Dawnstone'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Praxeti White'} category="Citadel Dry" />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />

I airbrushed a couple of grey tones, then gave it a light drybrush of white to over highlight it, ready for the
following wash to knock it back down. I then gave it a final gray highlight to bring everything together.

### Wood

<Paint name={'Dryad Bark'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'XV88'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Baneblade Brown'} />

I airbrushed a few different tones of brown, finishing with a brighter color than desired so the following wash
would both apply shadow to the wood grain and bring the overall brightness down to the desired finish.
Finally I gave it a light drybrush to help further emphasis the grain of the wood.

### Steel

<Paint name={'Iron Hands Steel'} />
<Paint name={'Space Wolves Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Knights Steel'} />

### Cloth

<Paint name={'Blood Angels Red'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Evil Sunz Scarlet'} />

### Bone

<Paint name={'Skeleton Horde'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Pallid Wych Flesh'} />

### Blood

<Paint name={'Blood For The Blood God'} />

## Base

No base!

## Roundup

This one was a fairly simple paint job following techniques used previously. They're getting easier the more I get done.
