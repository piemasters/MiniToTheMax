## Miniature Review

The Alchemist's Bench is a nice piece with a good amount of detail to it, with the bottles, scales, papers and
necklace. I like the mix of stone, wood and fabric giving it some different tones and opportunity for more colors.

Despite trying to straighten out the scales they keep bending over to one side, so I may need to add a skull to one side
so it doesn't look out of place.

## Painting Techniques

### Wood

<Paint name={'Dryad Bark'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'XV88'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Baneblade Brown'} />

I airbrushed a few different tones of brown, finishing with a brighter color than desired so the following wash
would both apply shadow to the wood grain and bring the overall brightness down to the desired finish.
Finally I gave it a light drybrush to help further emphasis the grain of the wood.

### Stone

<Paint name={'Dawnstone'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Praxeti White'} category="Citadel Dry" />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />

I airbrushed a couple of grey tones, then gave it a light drybrush of white to over highlight it, ready for the
following wash to knock it back down. I then gave it a final gray highlight to bring everything together.

### Steel

<Paint name={'Iron Hands Steel'} />
<Paint name={'Space Wolves Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Knights Steel'} />

### Gold

<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Liberator Gold'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Knights Steel'} />

### Paper

<Paint name={'Morghast Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Pallid Wych Flesh'} />

Once the paper was painted I then applied a number of different transfers to resemble text and drawings.

### Red Cloth

<Paint name={'Mephiston Red'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Mephiston Red'} />
<Paint name={'Evil Sunz Scarlet'} />

### Gem

<Paint name={'Warpstone Glow'} />
<Paint name={'Moot Green'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

### Inkwell

<Paint name={'Abaddon Black'} />
<Paint name={'Russ Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Fenrisian Grey'} />

### Bottles

I used a mix of different colors for the bottles, applying an Agrax Earthshade wash after the first base coat. I then
applied a lighter highlight to each then a final white highlight down the middle for the light reflection.

## Base

No base!

## Roundup

The transfers on the paper look great, far better than what I could freehand. I'll have to try it out again in the future
and maybe try and find somewhere that sells transfers for this kind of purpose rather than digging through my box of
everything I've collected over the years.
