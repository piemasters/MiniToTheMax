## Miniature Review

I think the original sculpt is better than this one, it has a more sinister and magical look. This one has more of an
egyptian acolyte feel, which is fine but not as the big baddie of the game. The weapon is also a bit of a mess, missing
almost all of the detail that the original design had.

To create the base I applied the vaseline to the rolling pin and worktop, then used the rolling pin on the milliput to
create a large area of stone flooring. Doing a large batch with all the miniatures cut off their bases, I used the round
cutters to cut the perfect size for each, then pushed them flat onto each base while wet to create a strong bond and
ensure they went on flat.

The Scratch Brush Pens can be used to clean the rolling pin, to ensure detail isn't lost for its next use.

Once dry I sprayed them all black then applied the following colors:

<Paint name={'Dawnstone'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Praxeti White'} category="Citadel Dry" />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Gutrippa Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />

The Gutrippa Flesh was applied in the recesses and in some patches to resemble moss. Once painting was finished I went
over those areas with the grass flock to finish them off.

Note if you try to glue a miniature to a completed base the bond will be very weak due to paint peeling away from the
milliput very easily. You need to scratch away some of the paint from the base where they join to ensure a strong bond.

## Roundup

I'm happier with the blue colorscheme compared to the purple one. As the robes are flowing more there was more
opportunity for highlighting which looks pretty nice.
