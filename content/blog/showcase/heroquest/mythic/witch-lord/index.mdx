## Miniature Review

I'm surprised this miniature comes in the Mythic tier and not in the Return of the Witch Lord box as he's right on the
cover of that box! It's a great miniature, much better than the other Dread Sorcerers in my opinion. The flowing long
robes are great and the detail on the helmet and weapon is a much better quality. I think I just really appreciate
how well it matches the artwork.

To create the base I applied the vaseline to the rolling pin and worktop, then used the rolling pin on the milliput to
create a large area of stone flooring. Doing a large batch with all the miniatures cut off their bases, I used the round
cutters to cut the perfect size for each, then pushed them flat onto each base while wet to create a strong bond and
ensure they went on flat.

The Scratch Brush Pens can be used to clean the rolling pin, to ensure detail isn't lost for its next use.

Once dry I sprayed them all black then applied the following colors:

<Paint name={'Dawnstone'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Praxeti White'} type={'dry'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Gutrippa Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />

The Gutrippa Flesh was applied in the recesses and in some patches to resemble moss. Once painting was finished I went
over those areas with the grass flock to finish them off.

Note if you try to glue a miniature to a completed base the bond will be very weak due to paint peeling away from the
milliput very easily. You need to scratch away some of the paint from the base where they join to ensure a strong bond.

## Roundup

I did my best to match the box for the colors on the robe and I think I came pretty close. It's much more of a magenta
than a pure red. The rest was just following patterns from the other miniatures to help tie him in.
