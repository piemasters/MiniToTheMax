## Miniature Review

These zombies also have a bit of a flat pose like the previous ones, but it's not quite as bad. I like the trailing
dragging foot and the curved knife to look a bit more sinister. I would have liked to see a bit more detail on them
though, as the dress is fairly plain beyond the odd tear.

To create the base I applied the vaseline to the rolling pin and worktop, then used the rolling pin on the milliput to
create a large area of stone flooring. Doing a large batch with all the miniatures cut off their bases, I used the round
cutters to cut the perfect size for each, then pushed them flat onto each base while wet to create a strong bond and
ensure they went on flat.

The Scratch Brush Pens can be used to clean the rolling pin, to ensure detail isn't lost for its next use.

Once dry I sprayed them all black then applied the following colors:

<Paint name={'Dawnstone'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Praxeti White'} type={'dry'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Gutrippa Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />

The Gutrippa Flesh was applied in the recesses and in some patches to resemble moss. Once painting was finished I went
over those areas with the grass flock to finish them off.

Note if you try to glue a miniature to a completed base the bond will be very weak due to paint peeling away from the
milliput very easily. You need to scratch away some of the paint from the base where they join to ensure a strong bond.

## Roundup

The skin came out a lot better on these compared to the more bronzed look on the other ones. I also decided to go with
a bit of a brighter green for their dress compared to the more military look on the trousers of the others. This might
have made them look a bit too bright, but I think they still tie in well when put together.
