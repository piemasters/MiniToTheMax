## Miniature Review

I like that they tried to keep the sculpts of the women characters similar to men so if you like one you should be
happy with the other. The pose is almost mirrored and the equipment is near identical. Overall it's a decent sculpt,
but I do wonder if the face lets it down a little bit as I feel like the sizing is slightly off.

To create the base I applied the vaseline to the rolling pin and worktop, then used the rolling pin on the milliput to
create a large area of stone flooring. Doing a large batch with all the miniatures cut off their bases, I used the round
cutters to cut the perfect size for each, then pushed them flat onto each base while wet to create a strong bond and
ensure they went on flat.

The Scratch Brush Pens can be used to clean the rolling pin, to ensure detail isn't lost for its next use.

Once dry I sprayed them all black then applied the following colors:

<Paint name={'Dawnstone'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Praxeti White'} type={'dry'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Gutrippa Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />

The Gutrippa Flesh was applied in the recesses and in some patches to resemble moss. Once painting was finished I went
over those areas with the grass flock to finish them off.

Note if you try to glue a miniature to a completed base the bond will be very weak due to paint peeling away from the
milliput very easily. You need to scratch away some of the paint from the base where they join to ensure a strong bond.

## Roundup

As with the barbarian from the main set I'm not the happiest with the overall look. Again I think it's mostly the skin
and the face. It might partly be down to the sculpt as well but the face feels too round or the forehead is too big
for the character so it doesn't quite look right. It's still good enough to look ok on the board with everything else
for now though.
