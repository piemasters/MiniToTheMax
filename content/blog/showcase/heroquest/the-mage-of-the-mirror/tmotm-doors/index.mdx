## Miniature Review

The first door is similar to others but a bit more ornate and covered in more vines. The second is blocked by a rather
imposing tree creature covered in thorns. They look good together as a set, while still fitting in nicely with the
doors in the base game as well as other expansions.

The portcullises really stand out compared to the rest of the doors and super ornate. There are a lot of layers to the
pillars on each side with sculptures and trim. Both the pillars and gates are adorned with gems, hinting at the wealth
of treasure that can be found inside.

## Painting Techniques

### Stone

<Paint name={'Dawnstone'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Praxeti White'} category="Citadel Dry" />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />

I airbrushed a couple of grey tones, then gave it a light drybrush of white to over highlight it, ready for the
following wash to knock it back down. I then gave it a final gray highlight to bring everything together.

### Wood

<Paint name={'Dryad Bark'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'XV88'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Baneblade Brown'} />

I airbrushed a few different tones of brown, finishing with a brighter color than desired so the following wash
would both apply shadow to the wood grain and bring the overall brightness down to the desired finish.
Finally I gave it a light drybrush to help further emphasis the grain of the wood.

### Gold

## Base

No base!

## Roundup

The more regular doors were fairly straight forward to paint, but the portcullises took ages. It was difficult to
determine what detail to paint gold and what to leave as stone. There's so much thin detail on them that it took a long
time to get them all done. I'm glad there were only 4!
