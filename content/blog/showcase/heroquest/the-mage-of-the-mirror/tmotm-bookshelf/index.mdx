## Miniature Review

These bookshelves are much more grand with a huge amount more detail than those in the core box. There is an absolute
ton of books, as well all kinds of other things like crystals, chests, bottles, trophies and more. The added vines and
candles also look great and frame them nicely.

## Painting Techniques

### Wood

<Paint name={'Dryad Bark'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'XV88'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Baneblade Brown'} />

I airbrushed a few different tones of brown, finishing with a brighter color than desired so the following wash
would both apply shadow to the wood grain and bring the overall brightness down to the desired finish.
Finally I gave it a light drybrush to help further emphasis the grain of the wood.

### Gold

### Steel

<Paint name={'Iron Hands Steel'} />
<Paint name={'Space Wolves Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Knights Steel'} />

### Books, Bottles & Crystals

I used a mix of different colors for the books, applying an Agrax Earthshade wash after the base coat. I then applied
highlight to each, focusing on the edges helping to contrast the covers for the paper.

No base!

## Roundup

I painted a lot of the detail fairly roughly as there were just so many things on the shelves. However, because there
is so much is looks great regardless. The colors I used work well together and aren't too bright so they don't look
too much like rainbows running along the shelves.
