## Miniature Review

These chests are very similar to the core game chests, but have the addition of some kind of dryad wrapping its vines
around the chest to hold it shut. It's fairly simple but a cool idea and matches the rest of the box. I like that the
lock is still visible indicating the chests can still be opened with the right key.

## Painting Techniques

### Wood

<Paint name={'Dryad Bark'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'XV88'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Baneblade Brown'} />

I airbrushed a few different tones of brown, finishing with a brighter color than desired so the following wash
would both apply shadow to the wood grain and bring the overall brightness down to the desired finish.
Finally I gave it a light drybrush to help further emphasis the grain of the wood.

### Gold

<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Liberator Gold'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Knights Steel'} />

### Steel

<Paint name={'Iron Hands Steel'} />
<Paint name={'Space Wolves Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Knights Steel'} />

### Vines (Brown)

<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />

## Base

No base!

## Roundup

These were quick to get through, although some of the vines got a bit fiddly. The vines came out a bit smooth, I would
have liked more colors and texture on them, but they do at least stand out nicely.
