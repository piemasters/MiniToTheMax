## Miniature Review

This tomb is much larger than the one in the core box. It has a very similar look but all the ornate details are
larger and more complex. It's missing the cloth on top though, so despite the metal carvings it's more plain than the
original.

## Painting Techniques

### Stone

<Paint name={'Dawnstone'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Praxeti White'} type={'dry'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />

I airbrushed a couple of grey tones, then gave it a light drybrush of white to over highlight it, ready for the
following wash to knock it back down. I then gave it a final gray highlight to bring everything together.

### Gold

<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Liberator Gold'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Knights Steel'} />
<Paint name={'Nihilakh Oxide'} />

### Steel

<Paint name={'Iron Hands Steel'} />
<Paint name={'Space Wolves Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Knights Steel'} />
<Paint name={'Stormhost Silver'} />

## Base

No base!

## Roundup

I wasn't sure on the best color for the suit of armour on top. Silver seemed too close to the stone, but the gold
would have made it blend in with the rest of the detail. In the end I went for a much brighter final look for the
steel to really make it stand out.
