## Miniature Review

The fireplace is almost identical to the one in the cores set, but has a rounded frame, a slightly better sculpted
fire and different helms on the statues. I like that the pair match but have enough differences to pick out the right
one when needed. It also gives the option for a different picture in the frame!

## Painting Techniques

### Wood

<Paint name={'Dryad Bark'} />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Baneblade Brown'} />

### Stone

<Paint name={'Dawnstone'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Praxeti White'} type={'dry'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />

I airbrushed a couple of grey tones, then gave it a light drybrush of white to over highlight it, ready for the
following wash to knock it back down. I then gave it a final gray highlight to bring everything together.

### Gold

<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Liberator Gold'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Knights Steel'} />

### Steel

<Paint name={'Iron Hands Steel'} />
<Paint name={'Space Wolves Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Knights Steel'} />

### Fire

<Paint name={'Bad Moon Yellow'} />
<Paint name={'Iyanden Yellow'} />
<Paint name={'Magmadroth Flame'} />
<Paint name={'Baal Red'} />
<Paint name={'Flesh Tearers Red'} />
<Paint name={'Abaddon Black'} />

As well as painting the flames, I used the same colors in the surrounding area for OSL.

### Painting

The painting is a photo of my dog that I added a crown to, then cut out and stuck within the frame. As it looked a bit
too neat I painted a blue background around him to help blend the print with the paint, then applied a thin wash of
Agrax Earthshade over the top to give it an aged look.

## Base

No base!

## Roundup

The fire came out great, one of my best attempts at fire as well as OSL. I'd love to do more of this in the future.
