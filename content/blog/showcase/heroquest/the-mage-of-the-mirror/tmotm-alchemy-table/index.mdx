## Miniature Review

This Alchemy Table is very similar to the one in the core set, but has a wooden top and a few different details on the
top like the melted coins and the pedestal and mortar. I prefer the original one, but again the two work well as a pair
and it's obvious what it is on the board.

## Painting Techniques

### Wood

<Paint name={'Dryad Bark'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'XV88'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Baneblade Brown'} />

I airbrushed a few different tones of brown, finishing with a brighter color than desired so the following wash
would both apply shadow to the wood grain and bring the overall brightness down to the desired finish.
Finally I gave it a light drybrush to help further emphasis the grain of the wood.

### Stone

<Paint name={'Dawnstone'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Praxeti White'} category="Citadel Dry" />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />

I airbrushed a couple of grey tones, then gave it a light drybrush of white to over highlight it, ready for the
following wash to knock it back down. I then gave it a final gray highlight to bring everything together.

### Steel

<Paint name={'Iron Hands Steel'} />
<Paint name={'Space Wolves Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Knights Steel'} />

### Gold

<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Liberator Gold'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Knights Steel'} />

### Paper

<Paint name={'Morghast Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Pallid Wych Flesh'} />

Once the paper was painted I then applied a number of different transfers to resemble text and drawings.

### Scale Pointer

<Paint name={'Mephiston Red'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Mephiston Red'} />
<Paint name={'Evil Sunz Scarlet'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

### Leather

<Paint name={'Gore Grunta Fur'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />

### Bottles

I used a mix of different colors for the bottles, applying an Agrax Earthshade wash after the first base coat. I then
applied a lighter highlight to each then a final white highlight down the middle for the light reflection.

## Base

No base!

## Roundup

Transfers are a life saver again and look great. Beyond that it was a fairly simple paint job, although the wood has
come out a bit richer brown compared to some of the other furniture.
