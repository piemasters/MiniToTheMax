## Miniature Review

The rune door is fairly plain and the runes themselves aren't very clear. The eye also isn't that well detailed and
could have been done a lot better. The giant skull on the other hand is great despite being fairly simple. The flames
are a great extra bit of detail.

## Painting Techniques

### Stone

<Paint name={'Dawnstone'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Praxeti White'} type={'dry'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />

I airbrushed a couple of grey tones, then gave it a light drybrush of white to over highlight it, ready for the
following wash to knock it back down. I then gave it a final gray highlight to bring everything together.

### Wood

<Paint name={'Dryad Bark'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'XV88'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Baneblade Brown'} />

I airbrushed a few different tones of brown, finishing with a brighter color than desired so the following wash
would both apply shadow to the wood grain and bring the overall brightness down to the desired finish.
Finally I gave it a light drybrush to help further emphasis the grain of the wood.

## Base

No bases but I did use Forge World weathering powders to add dirt around the doors and did add a few random grass
tufts to add a bit of variety.

## Roundup

Despite the low quality sculpts the runes came out ok with a subtle glowing look. The skull also came out pretty well,
but the fire isn't as realistic as the fireplace in the core set.
