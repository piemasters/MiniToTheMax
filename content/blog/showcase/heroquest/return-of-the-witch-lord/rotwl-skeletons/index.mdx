## Miniature Review

These skeletons are the same as those in the Core box set.

These guys are fine as fairly generic skeletons. The armour helps to give them a bit of bulk so they don't look too
fragile. I found a big mix in the quality of the sculpts, especially around the faces with a lot of detail lost in some
of them.

To create the base I applied the vaseline to the rolling pin and worktop, then used the rolling pin on the milliput to
create a large area of stone flooring. Doing a large batch with all the miniatures cut off their bases, I used the round
cutters to cut the perfect size for each, then pushed them flat onto each base while wet to create a strong bond and
ensure they went on flat.

The Scratch Brush Pens can be used to clean the rolling pin, to ensure detail isn't lost for its next use.

Once dry I sprayed them all black then applied the following colors:

<Paint name={'Dawnstone'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Praxeti White'} category="Citadel Dry" />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Gutrippa Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />

The Gutrippa Flesh was applied in the recesses and in some patches to resemble moss. Once painting was finished I went
over those areas with the grass flock to finish them off.

Note if you try to glue a miniature to a completed base the bond will be very weak due to paint peeling away from the
milliput very easily. You need to scratch away some of the paint from the base where they join to ensure a strong bond.

## Roundup

Although they were a bit fiddly it didn't take too long to paint them up. I tried using contrast paints for the cloth
but the color wasn't any where near as bright as the layer paints so I stuck with them in the end. The blue glow from
the eyes and mouth helps frame the mini nicely and stops them being too plain.
