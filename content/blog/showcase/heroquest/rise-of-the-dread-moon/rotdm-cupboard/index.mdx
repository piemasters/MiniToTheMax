## Miniature Review

This Cupboard has a lot more detail on it compared to the core box. The lanterns help to scale it and the vines
give the opportunity to break up the color and give it a different texture. It remains fairly simple as it should,
but isn't just a block of wood so looks nicer on the board.

## Painting Techniques

### Wood

<Paint name={'Dryad Bark'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'XV88'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Baneblade Brown'} />

I airbrushed a few different tones of brown, finishing with a brighter color than desired so the following wash
would both apply shadow to the wood grain and bring the overall brightness down to the desired finish.
Finally I gave it a light drybrush to help further emphasis the grain of the wood.

### Gold

<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Liberator Gold'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Knights Steel'} />

### Lights

<Paint name={'Iyanden Yellow'} />
<Paint name={'Phalanx Yellow'} />

### Vines

<Paint name={'Elysian Green'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Elysian Green'} />

## Base

No base!

## Roundup

I like how the green of the vines breaks things up nicely. The lights also adds an extra color, although maybe I
should have added a bit more contrast with some reds, even going to black.
