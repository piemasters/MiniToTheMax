## Miniature Review

The first door is similar to others but a bit more ornate and covered in more vines. The second is blocked by a rather
imposing tree creature covered in thorns. They look good together as a set, while still fitting in nicely with the
doors in the base game as well as other expansions.

## Painting Techniques

### Stone

<Paint name={'Dawnstone'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Praxeti White'} category="Citadel Dry" />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />

I airbrushed a couple of grey tones, then gave it a light drybrush of white to over highlight it, ready for the
following wash to knock it back down. I then gave it a final gray highlight to bring everything together.

### Wood

<Paint name={'Dryad Bark'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'XV88'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Baneblade Brown'} />

I airbrushed a few different tones of brown, finishing with a brighter color than desired so the following wash
would both apply shadow to the wood grain and bring the overall brightness down to the desired finish.
Finally I gave it a light drybrush to help further emphasis the grain of the wood.

The wooden face has a final drybrush of Skrag Brown rather than Baneblade Brown to stand out more.

## Base

No bases but I did use Forge World weathering powders to add dirt around the doors and did add a few random grass
tufts to add a bit of variety.

## Roundup

The first door came out great. I went with a brighter brown to highlight the tree face covering the second door to
help it really stand out. It's done that job well, but maybe doesn't look the most wood like. I think it was the right
idea but I probably applied it too thick so it lacks the different tones.
