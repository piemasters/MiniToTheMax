## Miniature Review

There's a lot of detail in these statues, maybe more so than some of the miniatures. I really like the idea and they
look great, being more realistic rather than some more chunky statues. The trim around the bottom is also really
detailed and gives the option for a bit of additional color.

## Painting Techniques

### Stone

<Paint name={'Dawnstone'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Praxeti White'} type={'dry'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />

I airbrushed a couple of grey tones, then gave it a light drybrush of white to over highlight it, ready for the
following wash to knock it back down. I then gave it a final gray highlight to bring everything together.

### Gold

<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Liberator Gold'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Knights Steel'} />

## Base

No base!

## Roundup

The stone was easy to paint just like with everything else but looks good with the additional detail. I really like
how the bright gold looks at the base, making them look much more regal.
