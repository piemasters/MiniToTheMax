## Miniature Review

The Arcane Prison is another form of torture rack found in the core box. This one is much more magical, with many
faces swirling within a transparent plastic, seemingly sucked in via the machinery powering prison. It's a great idea
having clear plastic for something like this and it really stands out because of it. Ti'd look great with an LED
underneath with some flickering.

## Painting Techniques

### Stone

<Paint name={'Dawnstone'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Praxeti White'} category="Citadel Dry" />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />

I airbrushed a couple of grey tones, then gave it a light drybrush of white to over highlight it, ready for the
following wash to knock it back down. I then gave it a final gray highlight to bring everything together.

### Steel

<Paint name={'Iron Hands Steel'} />
<Paint name={'Space Wolves Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Knights Steel'} />

### Gold

<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Liberator Gold'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Knights Steel'} />

### Cloth

<Paint name={'Blood Angels Red'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Evil Sunz Scarlet'} />

### Gem

<Paint name={'Warpstone Glow'} />
<Paint name={'Moot Green'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

### Portal

<Paint name={'Hexwraith Flame'} />
<Paint name={'Tesseract Glow'} />

Both paints were applied very thinly in multiple layers, into both the recesses and around the faces.

## Base

No base!

## Roundup

Initially I left the top plastic fully transparent, but you couldn't really make out the detail. It felt like a bit
of a risk adding paint to it, but with several thin layers I think it came out great and still has some level of
transparency.
