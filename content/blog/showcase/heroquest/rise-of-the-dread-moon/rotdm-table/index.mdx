## Miniature Review

This table is a different shape to those in the core set, with a more ornate elegant look. It has a much finer, fancier
trim running underneath that looks good but is a bit hidden by the overhang of the table top.

## Painting Techniques

### Wood

<Paint name={'Dryad Bark'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'XV88'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Baneblade Brown'} />

I airbrushed a few different tones of brown, finishing with a brighter color than desired so the following wash
would both apply shadow to the wood grain and bring the overall brightness down to the desired finish.
Finally I gave it a light drybrush to help further emphasis the grain of the wood.

### Gold

<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Liberator Gold'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Knights Steel'} />

## Base

No base!

## Roundup

A fairly quick and simple one to paint. The detail around the legs wasn't great in places but is fairly well hidden so
not a massive issue.
