## Miniature Review

The snow on top of these doors looks great an I love all the icicles hanging from all the raised areas. Normally I would
cover the snow with a powdered snow to make it look more realistic, but I think these will look fine as they are as
the snow is well textured. Also the massive ice giant face on the door is awesome, it would have been great to see a
unit of them in the game!

## Painting Techniques

### Stone

<Paint name={'Dawnstone'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Praxeti White'} type={'dry'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />

I airbrushed a couple of grey tones, then gave it a light drybrush of white to over highlight it, ready for the
following wash to knock it back down. I then gave it a final gray highlight to bring everything together.

### Wood

<Paint name={'Dryad Bark'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'XV88'} type={'air'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Baneblade Brown'} />

I airbrushed a few different tones of brown, finishing with a brighter color than desired so the following wash
would both apply shadow to the wood grain and bring the overall brightness down to the desired finish.
Finally I gave it a light drybrush to help further emphasis the grain of the wood.

### Gold

<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Liberator Gold'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Knights Steel'} />

### Runes

<Paint name={'Talassar Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Teclis Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Baharroth Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

### Snow

<Paint name={'Talassar Blue'} />

## Base

<Paint name={'Corax White'} />
<Paint name={'Pylar Glacier'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />
<Paint name={'White Scar'} />

No bases but I did use Forge World weathering powders to add dirt around the doors and did add a few random grass
tufts to add a bit of variety.

## Roundup

I'm really happy with the snow, the blue wash over the top looks great, especially on the ice giant face. I used the
same palette for the doors as normal so hopefully despite the snow they should fit in well.
