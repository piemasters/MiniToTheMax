## Miniature Review

For the second of the Squidmar paint sets I decided to paint a the elf. I wanted to try out the OSL techniques learnt
from the previous orc lava base, this time with a one directional purple hue.

The miniature itself has a great base to practice on, and there are a few different textures from the armour to the
cloak to the skin that allows for a variety of techniques to be used.

## Painting Techniques

Rather than list all the paints I used I'll point to the tutorial I followed. All paints were from the Squidmar sets.

## Roundup

As previously I limited myself to a couple of hours to wrk my way through the tutorial and get the miniature to a point
I could call it done. I'm really happy with the results, the OSL effect is really striking and I think I've managed to
achieve a half decent NMM effect on the armour. I still need a lot more time and practice to get the hang of it but
it's a good first step.
