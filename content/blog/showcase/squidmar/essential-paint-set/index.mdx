## Miniature Review

I chose to paint the dwarf last as it didn't have the amount of OSL or NMM on it that I really wanted to try out.

The sculpt itself is fairly simple, but as with the others has a good range of textures and details to test out the
paints in the set out. The face is really well sculpted, being the focal point on the miniature, and the log is nicely
done too.

Here are some ways that the paints in the range are best used:

### Core

<Paint name="White" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="Black" category="Vallejo Model Color" />

These two paints are used for mixing most of the other colors needed for the miniature.

### Skin

<Paint name="Dark Rust" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="Burnt Red" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="Dark Fleshtone" category="Vallejo Game Color" />
<Paint name="Sunny Skin Tone" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="Skin Tone" category="Vallejo Game Color" />
<Paint name="Light Flesh" category="Vallejo Model Color" />

Start by mixing Burnt Red 50:50 with Sunny Skin Tone to create a base shadow color for the skin. Then slowly add more
and more Sunny Skin Tone to the mix to create midtones and highlights. Finally add a small amount of Light Flesh to the
mix, or Ice Yellow for a warmer highlight.

Alternatively for a paler flesh, substitute Sunny Skin Tone for Skin Tone, great for vampires and the like.

For darker skin start with Dark Rust, then use Dark Fleshtone as the midtone, then either Sunny Skin Tone or Skin Tone
for the highlights. For something more desaturated, start with Dark Rust and mix in Sunny Skin Tone to highlight all
the way up.

### Copper

### Highlighting

<Paint name="Light Flesh" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="Sunny Skin Tone" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="Ice Yellow" category="Vallejo Model Color" />

These colors are used to highlight more of less everything, blue, red, orange, green etc. For example:

- Highlighting a tree - Sunny Skin Tone
- Highlighting steel or orc skin - Ice Yellow
- Highlighting cold blue or red - Light Flesh

Then for the remaining colors the following are used:

<Paint name="Ivory" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="White" category="Vallejo Model Color" />

### Browns

<Paint name="Dark Rust" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="Dark Fleshtone" category="Vallejo Game Color" />
<Paint name="Japanese Uniform WWII" category="Vallejo Model Color" />

These browns are all great for materials like leather, trees and horns.

Japanese Uniform WWII is also great for shading yellow, or mixing with Ice Yellow to create sandy bases.

Mixing Dark Rust and Japanese Uniform WWII is also great with horns and ropes, which can then be highlighted up with
Sunny Skin Tone.

### Deck Tan

<Paint name="Deck Tan" category="Vallejo Model Color" />

It can be used as a midtone for none metallic steel. It can even be mixed with another color such as green or blue to
create a colored non-metallic effect.

It's also great for horns, leather, stones and highlighting bones. Another use is as a midtone when painting white,
and when zenithal highlighting with an airbrush.

### Inks

<Paint name="Magenta Ink" category="Vallejo Game Color" />
<Paint name="Skin Ink" category="Vallejo Game Color" />

These paints don't have any medium and are super vicious, so are best used though an airbrush.

Skin Ink is great for tinting skin, spraying from below to add some warmth to the skin tones. It's also great for
shading wood and leather.

Magenta Ink can also be used to add some vibrancy to skin such as cheeks, as well as shading blues from below.

## Painting Techniques

Rather than list all the paints I used for each part of the miniature I'll point to the tutorials I followed.
All paints were from the Squidmar sets, mostly from those listed above included in the box set.

## Roundup

I think the skin came out really well, and the red glaze at the end added a lot of character to the piece. The log
came out pretty well too, although I'm not sure about the freehand vines on it. The tutorials didn't say how to paint
the base so I just went with a similar look to the previous two and I think it really helped with the woodland feel.

Overall I'm glad I bought the paint sets and got to practice a few new techniques with some different paints. I really
need to paint this way more often, not worrying about keeping miniatures consistent and just trying out techniques to
learn and improve. Hopefully I can do this with some of my odd projects like HeroQuest and other boxed games.
