## Miniature Review

I bought the full set of Squidmar paints as I've been wanting to buy some Vallejo paints to try them out but didn't
really know where to start. It's also great to get a free miniature alongside them to try out the paints on.

Being removed from the Warhammer world meant I it wouldn't become part of an army so I wasn't worried about messing
up the paint job. This allowed me to experiment with the paints and try some techniques I wouldn't normally use. It was
really freeing and I was amazed how quickly the paint job came together

## Painting Techniques

Rather than list all the paints I used for each part of the miniature I'll point to the tutorials I followed.
All paints were from the Squidmar sets, mostly from those listed above included in the box set.

## Roundup

I have to say I'm impressed buy the results The paints are smooth and easy to work with, and the OSL effect I achieved
following the tutorial is by far the best I've ever done. I'm looking forward to trying out the rest of the paints in
the set and seeing what other effects I can achieve.
