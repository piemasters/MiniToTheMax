## Miniature Review

I bought the full set of Squidmar paints as I've been wanting to buy some Vallejo paints to try them out but didn't
really know where to start. It's also great to get a free miniature alongside them to try out the paints on.

Being removed from the Warhammer world meant I it wouldn't become part of an army so I wasn't worried about messing
up the paint job. This allowed me to experiment with the paints and try some techniques I wouldn't normally use. It was
really freeing and I was amazed how quickly the paint job came together

Here are some ways that the paints in the range are best used:

### Ivory

<Paint name="Ivory" category="Vallejo Model Color" />

Ivory is a great highlight color for everything, when ou want to go up close to white but not all the way. It's that
bit more desaturated compared to Ice Yellow and Light Flesh so great when you need it.

### Golds

<Paint name="Tinny Tin" category="Vallejo Game Color" />
<Paint name="Glorious Gold" category="Vallejo Game Color" />

Tinny Tin works great as the shadow color, and Glorious Gold for the highlights.They mix well together to create a
smooth transition from shadow to highlight. Glorious Gold looks great as a final highlight with no need to go up to
silver.

Tinny Tin makes a great copper just by itself, with a turquoise wash to give it some oxidation. Silver can be used
to create a highlight but you don't really want to go over 50:50 mix as it quickly becomes too silvery.

### Greens

<Paint name="Dark Green" category="Vallejo Game Color" />
<Paint name="Cayman Green" category="Vallejo Game Color" />
<Paint name="Lime Green" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="Yellow Green" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="Scorpy Green" category="Vallejo Game Color" />

Dark Green almost always works as the best shadow color. Then mixin up to 50:50 Lime Green for midtones gives you a
great emerald green. Once you've reached a clean Lime Green there's a few options to take. Using Yellow Green as a
highlight will make it super vibrant. Alternatively you can use Ice Yellow for a slightly less vibrant highlight,
or even Ivory for a more desaturated highlight.

While these greens are very warm greens, Scorpy Green is a bit cooler and can be used as an alternative for Lime Green.

Cayman Green is great for military green. An alternative is to mix Lime Green with Dark Rust to create a more olive
green. Cayman Green is also great for a greenish wood

### Reds

<Paint name="Gory Red" category="Vallejo Game Color" />
<Paint name="Scarlet Blood" category="Vallejo Game Color" />
<Paint name="Hot Orange" category="Vallejo Game Color" />
<Paint name="Moon Yellow" category="Vallejo Game Color" />

To create a vibrant red, start with Gory Red as the shadow color, then mix in Scarlet Blood to create midtones. Once
you reach a clean Scarlet Blood you can either use Hot Orange for a vibrant highlight, or Light Flesh or Sunny Skin Tone
for a more desaturated highlight. You can even mix all of these together to create various tones.

Hot Orange & Scarlet Blood can be mixed in with skin tones to gives them a warm, sun kissed look.

Hot Orange is a great midtone and can be shaded with Magenta as a glaze. You could also use the Skin Ink through the
airbrush as a shadow, with a highlight of Hot Orange mixed with Sunny Skin Tone.

Where as Sun Yellow is a very warm yellow, Moon Yellow is a bit cooler and is a great alternative if you want a cooler
highlight.

## Painting Techniques

Rather than list all the paints I used for each part of the miniature I'll point to the tutorials I followed.
All paints were from the Squidmar sets, mostly from those listed above included in the box set.

## Roundup

I have to say I'm impressed buy the results The paints are smooth and easy to work with, and the OSL effect I achieved
following the tutorial is by far the best I've ever done. I'm looking forward to trying out the rest of the paints in
the set and seeing what other effects I can achieve.
