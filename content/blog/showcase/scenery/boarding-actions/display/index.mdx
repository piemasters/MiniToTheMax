> Boarding Actions brings the action into the tight confines of space-faring vessels, represented by the Boarding
> Actions terrain kits. In the cold void of space, the missions are critical and the fighting is up-close and brutal.

This is just a quick post following the previous one showing the Boarding Actions terrain set up for one of the
scenarios in the rule book. I dug out my Space Wolves and Nurgle armies to show off the terrain in a game
setting. I also used some of the new Killzone terrain pieces to add a bit of variety to the layout.
