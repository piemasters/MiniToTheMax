## Miniature Review

I've always enjoyed the tighter, more confined battlefields when playing games in the 40k universe. The Boarding Actions
sets, all introduced via Kill Team with a number of Killzone terrain sets. These sets are designed to be modular,
allowing you to create a variety of different layouts, reminding me of the old Space Hulk games.

Although from a distance the terrain pieces seem fairly plain, when you look closely there is a huge amount of detail
on them. Skulls (as always), pipes, monitors, fans, lights and various other details. Not only does the layout and rules
make for great games, but they work really well as interesting backdrops for photos.

As I have such a large backlog I decided to buy a painted set on eBay. This way I can always add my own additions
to the set in the future, but in the mean time I can use them for games and photos. The set I purchased included:

04x - A1 Long Wall
04x - A2 Long Wall - Pillars
04x - A3 Long Wall - Hatchway
04x - A4 Long Wall - Hatchway & Pillars
04x - B1 Short Wall
04x - B2 Short Wall - Hatchway
08x - B3 Short Wall - Hatchway & Pillars
10x - C1-C5 Killzone Gallowdark
06x - D1-D3 Killzone Shadowvaults
08x - E1-E2 Killzone Soulshackle
02x - Killzone Into the Dark Overhead Pipe
36 x - Pillars
04x - Wall Ends

I really like the use of two colors and I think it will make for somme interesting games and gives more options for
backdrops for photos.

## Painting Techniques

I'm not fully sure on the colors used, but I will update this section if I find out or try to replicate them in the
future.

## Roundup

I'm really happy with these pieces, and will be sure to post a board with it all set up soon!
