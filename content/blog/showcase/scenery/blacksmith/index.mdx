The Blacksmith is finally finished! It was a great project and I've learnt so much for building more in the future.
It's far better than I thought it would ever turn out and will look great on the table.

I've always enjoyed building terrain but have never made anything this good from scratch! There are templates for a
larger tavern so maybe in 6-12 months I'll decide to give it another go.

I just want to say a big thank you to [Real Terrain Hobbies](https://realterrainhobbies.com/). I've learn so much from
watching you videos in the past, and this box made it so much more accessible for learning your techniques and the
videos you provided were super useful.

As always here's some photos of the final piece, and go back and check my updates to see how I built it if you haven't
already!
