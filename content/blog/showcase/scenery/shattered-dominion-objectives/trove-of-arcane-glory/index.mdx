>  A collection of magical loot – books, scrolls and a sextant – surrounding an open chest, in which more books,
> scrolls and potion bottles are found;

## Miniature Review

The final miniature is probably the most complicated to paint. Just look at all those books! There's also a few other
items of interest, including some kind of globe, some kind of star watching apparatus and a number of potions sitting
within the chest.

All the bits surrounding the chest give the objective a good size and all the bent scrolls and flowing paper add some
nice shape to pull everything together.

Each book and bottle was given a contrast paint base, then highlighted using a layer paint. The paints listed above show
the 8 different combinations used. The bottles and globe were also given an Ardcoat layer to make them shiny.

## Roundup

I'm not happy with how the globe came out, I really don't think I should have made it shiny. I'm not fully sure how I
should paint it though, so I'm going to leave it for now and see if I get a good idea in the future.

In contrast, I am happy with the mix of colours for the books and the writing actually came out alright for how quickly
I did it. Using a pen is so much easier than using a brush!

Well that's the set done, next up I'll get a couple of photos of everything together.
