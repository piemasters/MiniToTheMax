## Miniature Review

I don't think there can be a better objective than a big ol' chest of treasure! The gold coins look great spilling out
of the chest and the odd potion, goblet and magic lamp help to break it up.

The chest top is on a hinge, allowing you to open and close it. For display purposes I'm sure everyone would want to
keep it open, but it's great to have the option for games to show when it's been captured.

## Roundup

I really like how the green came out, I need to paint an army using a similar scheme. The potions came out looking like
something from Diablo, which is a nice touch I wasn't expecting.

One chest complete, one left to go and then the set of objectives are done!
