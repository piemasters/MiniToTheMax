So that's another set complete! Once again it was fairly quick to do using contrast points where possible, and it looks
great all put together. They should look great when playing a game of Age of Sigmar in the future and add a bit more
narrative to the game.

Painting these, along with the endless spells was a breath of fresh air and has made me want to get stuck into some more
projects and really tackle my backlog. First up I think I'm going to make a dent in my Space Wolves, then maybe try to
finally finish off my Grey Knight army from years ago.

I do really want to paint the new HeroQuest release though!
