## Miniature Review

After finishing the endless spell set I thought I'd choose another similar project that I could paint relatively
quickly. The Shattered Dominion box was sat next to the endless spells, perfect!

The Soul Stone piqued my interest being the biggest of the objectives. The effect of the chains tying the stone to the
ground, preventing it from floating away is awesome. The stones they're anchored to are also a great touch, avoiding
the need for a large base.

There's loads of ghostly faces trying to escape the stone that blend really well into it. There's a lot of unique
expressions, making it interesting to look at from all angles. Overall it makes for a great mini.

### Stone
<Paint name={'Black Templar'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Seer'} />
<Paint name={'Warp Lightning'} />
<Paint name={'Niblet Green'} />
<Paint name={'Hellion Green'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

I coated the entire stone a layer of Black Templar, then picked out the areas with the faces with Grey Seer. This meant
when applying a layer of Warp Lightning over the whole stone the green acts as a glaze for the stone itself, while the
faces come out as a strong green. I then highlighted the faces out more towards the center of each, so they fade into
the stone.

## Painting Techniques

### Base
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Stirland Mud'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />

With the base fully brown and will a bit of texture I then added
[Patchy Plains](https://www.geekgamingscenics.com/collections/base-ready-range/products/lukes-aps-base-ready-patchy-plains)
to the base. It's a good mix of different sands and flock that gives the base a great look with minimal effort.

Once dried I then added both [Army Painter Lowland Shrubs](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B086MBW9R9) and
[Army Painter Swamp Tufts](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07R8GZQYR) to break up the flat areas left by the
Patchy Plains.

## Roundup

Using Black Templar is great for making something look black, but still being light enough that a coloured glaze still
shows up really well. It really helped with blending the faces into the stone and gives the whole thing a really
ghostly, haunted effect.

Adding the rust also helped to break up the chains and add a bit more contrasting colour to the first objective.
