## Miniature Review

The tomb has a surprising amount of detail on it. The statue on top is huge and looks really realistic with the cracks
running through it. The symbols surrounding it add a bit of colour to the stone and are large enough to show up clearly
from a distance.

The big surprise is the matching skeleton inside the tomb. It's a great addition matching the statue nicely, the only
thing missing is some kind of bedding for him to rest on rather than just being on a flat surface.

## Roundup

I wasn't sure how painting the entire outside of the tomb one colour would look, but with the washes and highlights it
looks just like stone and isn't too flat or dull. I kept the skeleton inside fairly simple for now, as it's not likely
that I'll actually see it that much.

At some point it would be good to add some weathering to it and maybe some kind of surrounding bedding to bring it to
life a bit more (although still very much dead!).
