## Miniature Review

Dungeons and Lasers is a modular terrain system that allows you to build a dungeon layout to suit your needs.
The system is designed to be easy to assemble and disassemble, and the pieces are made from a durable plastic that
can be purchased unpainted or pre-painted using their PrismaCast technology.

I purchased a number of PrismaCast sets, as I already have a large collection of unpainted miniatures and terrain. I
went with:

- 2x Enhanced Fantasy Starter Set
- 1x Enhanced Torture Chambers
- 1x Enhanced Hall of Heroes
- 1x Enhanced Dwarven Mines

My hope was that even if the paint job wasn't great then at least it would give me a base to work from. Although it's
not an amazing paint job with a limited color palette they actually look pretty great once you've got some miniatures
and furniture on them.

My main complaint is that they come with a bit of a gloss or satin finish which doesn't look great when it catches
the light. I'll have to spray some matt varnish over them to dull them down at some point.

Other than that my only other issues are that there are a lot of holes left for decorations such as torches that I would
have liked to have seen included, and there is no support for single width tiles making it difficult to use them for
games like HeroQuest.

I do wish that the color palette used was greater too, but this is a super new technology so I'm sure they'll expand on
it in the future and it's good enough for now and can be fixed with some spare time and paint.

## Painting Techniques

No painting required, awesome right!?

## Roundup

I'm really happy I bought them and I hope to get a lot of use out of them for games in the future. I could have saved
myself some money by buying the unpainted versions and painting them myself, but they could easily have sat unpainted
for years and I'm really glad I have them now to use and haven't expanded my backlog.

I've got a lot more of their caves coming in the future, with at least so much pre-painted so it'll be interesting to
see if the technology has improved when they come out and how well the two different sets work with each other.
