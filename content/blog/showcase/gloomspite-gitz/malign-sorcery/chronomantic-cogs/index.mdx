## Miniature Review



## Painting Techniques

### Cogs
<Paint name={'Castellax Bronze'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Castellax Bronze'} />
<Paint name={'Sycorax Bronze'} />
<Paint name={'Sycorax Bronze'} />
<Paint name={'Necron Compound'} />

### Smoke
<Paint name={'Grey Seer'} />



### Base
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Stirland Mud'} />

With the base fully brown and will a bit of texture I then added
[Patchy Plains](https://www.geekgamingscenics.com/collections/base-ready-range/products/lukes-aps-base-ready-patchy-plains)
to the base. It's a good mix of different sands and flock that gives the base a great look with minimal effort.

Once dried I then added both [Army Painter Lowland Shrubs](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B086MBW9R9) and
[Army Painter Swamp Tufts](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07R8GZQYR) to break up the flat areas left by the
Patchy Plains.
