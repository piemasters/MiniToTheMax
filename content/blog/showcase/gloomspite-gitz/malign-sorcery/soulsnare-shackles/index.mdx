I'm becoming more and more aware of my ever-increasing backlog, so I really want to tick some easy win miniatures off
the first. The Malign Sorcery endless spells are a set of reasonably large and fairly simplistic miniatures that seem
ideal for getting painted quickly using metallic and contrast paints, as well as a little highlighting.

## Miniature Review

First up are the Soulsnare Shackles. They are the least interesting of the set, being just some chains and shackles
with no real detail. This means I'll have to add some rust, dirt and grease to them to give them a bit of colour and
visual interest.

Alternatively I could give them a more ghostly look, or add some kind of magical sheen to them. For now though I'm
looking to get some miniatures painted fast, so rust it will be!

## Painting Techniques

### Metal
<Paint name={'Leadbelcher'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Nuln Oil'} />
<Paint name={'Iron Hands Steel'} />
<Paint name={'Runefang Steel'} />
<Paint name={'Stormhost Silver'} />

### Rust
<Paint name={'Typhus Corrosion'} />
<Paint name={'Ryza Rust'} />

### Base
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Stirland Mud'} />

With the base fully brown and will a bit of texture I then added
[Patchy Plains](https://www.geekgamingscenics.com/collections/base-ready-range/products/lukes-aps-base-ready-patchy-plains)
to the base. It's a good mix of different sands and flock that gives the base a great look with minimal effort.

Once dried I then added both [Army Painter Lowland Shrubs](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B086MBW9R9) and
[Army Painter Swamp Tufts](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07R8GZQYR) to break up the flat areas left by the
Patchy Plains.

## Roundup

Overall there wasn't much to these models. I could have done a lot more on the weathering front, but for now I want to
keep it simple. The rust and washes add enough to make them look realistic, and I wouldn't want to go too over the top
anyway.
