## Miniature Review

The swords are one of my favorite spells in the box. Although it's quite a flat miniature it still looks good for a lot
of angles. It's been really cleverly put together as well to make all the swords individually float wit just the thin
flame being used to keep it all together.

It's also probably the most dangerous looking spell so far, with rather large swords being shot out of flames from
overhead.

## Painting Techniques

### Steel
<Paint name={'Leadbelcher'} />
<Paint name={'Nuln Oil'} />
<Paint name={'Leadbelcher'} />
<Paint name={'Runefang Steel'} />
<Paint name={'Necron Compound'} />

I kept the lower half of each sword relatively un-highlighted, with more of a focus on the top to add some contrast
and shadow.

### Gold
<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Liberator Gold'} />
<Paint name={'Stormhost Silver'} />

### Flames
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />
<Paint name={'Iyanden Yellow'} />
<Paint name={'Nazdreg Yellow'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

### Base
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Stirland Mud'} />

With the base fully brown and will a bit of texture I then added
[Patchy Plains](https://www.geekgamingscenics.com/collections/base-ready-range/products/lukes-aps-base-ready-patchy-plains)
to the base. It's a good mix of different sands and flock that gives the base a great look with minimal effort.

Once dried I then added both [Army Painter Lowland Shrubs](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B086MBW9R9) and
[Army Painter Swamp Tufts](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07R8GZQYR) to break up the flat areas left by the
Patchy Plains.

## Roundup

I painted the flames in the same way as I did the burning head. It means the colours are inversed from light to dark,
but it's so much quicker to do! I also left some spillover of the yellow contrast paints on the swords, as it  actually
made for some great OSL effects.
