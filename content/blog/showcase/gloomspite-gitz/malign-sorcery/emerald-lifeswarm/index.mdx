## Miniature Review

I really like the idea of the Emerald Lifeswarm. A huge swarm of bugs in a dynamic shape all flying out of a skull
looks great.

The main problem with it though is it just doesn't look great at most viewing angles. It looks very flat,
and it's difficult to make out what it is unless it's facing away from you. I think it should have been given a bit
more depth and given a more curved flight pattern to make it more viewable from the sides and front.

There's also not a huge amount of varied detail, although each bug is quite small it's unlikely people will look at them
individually in much depth. It will make painting them really easy at least!

## Painting Techniques

### Swarm

<Paint name={'Warp Lightning'} />
<Paint name={'Niblet Green'} />
<Paint name={'Hellion Green'} />
<Paint name={'Praxeti White'} />

I applied the Warp Lightning in a number of thin layers using 50:50 Contrast Medium, then added finer and finer layers
of the drybrush to really increase the contrast and show the details of each dragonfly. Warp Lightning can be reapplied
into the recesses if you apply too much highlighting to certain areas.

### Skull
<Paint name={'Morghast Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Rakarth Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />

### Base
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Stirland Mud'} />

With the base fully brown and will a bit of texture I then added
[Patchy Plains](https://www.geekgamingscenics.com/collections/base-ready-range/products/lukes-aps-base-ready-patchy-plains)
to the base. It's a good mix of different sands and flock that gives the base a great look with minimal effort.

Once dried I then added both [Army Painter Lowland Shrubs](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B086MBW9R9) and
[Army Painter Swamp Tufts](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07R8GZQYR) to break up the flat areas left by the
Patchy Plains.

## Roundup

It's great being able to paint with spells with just a couple of colour palettes. In the future I might pick out a few
bugs with slightly varying colours just to create a bit more interest, but it looks finished now as it is with minimal
effort which is great!
