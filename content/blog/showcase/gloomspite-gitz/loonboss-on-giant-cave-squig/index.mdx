As mentioned in my previous post I recently purchased the Stampending Squigalanche boxset. In it you get:

- 1x Loonboss on Giant Cave Squig
- 2x Loonboss on Mangler Squig
- 10x Squig Hoppers
- 10x Cave Squigs
- 2x Squig Herder

I've been batch painting the box set but its been taking a while, there' an awful lot of squigs! For this week I
managed to get the Loonboss on Giant Cave Squig finished.

## Miniature Review

I'm a little bit conflicted about this one. I really love the size of the squig and it has an amazing pose leaping
forward off the mushroom. I also love the huge open jaw and the massive tongue. I think there's just something about
the shape or maybe of the eyes I'm not entirely happy with. It feels very tall, and I think I prefer more squat round
squigs. I think the eyes are too small and bug-like too. I think making them bigger would allow for a lot more character.

I really like the grot sat on top, it feels like their take on Bretonnian Knights which I loved in the old Warhammer
days. Because of this guy I have to build the Squig Hoppers as Boingrot Bounderz as the armour and lances look great
on squigs.

Lastly I like the moon spider running along underneath, and thought it was a good idea to add a terrified snotling
running away from both of them.

### Squig Skin

<Paint name={'Flesh Tearers Red'} />

## Roundup

It's great ot have finally finished something in the box set. I really like how the skin on the squig came out, even
though it's not smooth the quickly highlighted lines give a great effect. I'm also fairly happy with the yellow
armour, it adds a lot more interest than everything just being steel. I'd mainly like to improve the steel for the
Bounderz and maybe the spear/lance shafts.
