## Miniature Review

The next miniature in the old Forgeworld Night Goblin Command Set, this guy isn't exactly a loonboss but feels far
too epic to just be a lowly rank and file grot. The double standard is huge and there's so much great detail in the
moons it really stands out when down on the table.

The pole is made from a number of gnarly branches, covered in mushrooms and the trophies from a number of dwarves,
including heads, skulls, helmets and beards. The pose of the grot is great too, making him look like a true leader
rather than a lowly grot struggling to pull the huge thing along.

## Roundup

I'm really happy with how the moons on the banners came out. It brought out the detail really well and stands out
amongst the army of squigs. I was worried it could look flat. It can be really difficult highlighting large areas of
black, if you don't go bright enough you can't see any detail, if you overhighlight it stops looking black.
I think I got the highlighting just right and it looks great, giving enough interest to not look flat but not take
away from the moons.
