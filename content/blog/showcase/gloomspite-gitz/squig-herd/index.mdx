## Miniature Review

My next few projects might be a bit scattered, but I really want to get back into my Gloomspite Gitz. I originally
painted a big unit of 40 goblins back before Age of Sigmar, and have since added the odd character or monster but
not enough to make a real army. All that starts to change with this beginning of a Squigalanche!

I've always loved Squigs, they're the main reason for collecting Gitz! They have so much personality and this box has
such a range of facial expressions and all have so much movement, bounding forwards all teeth and anger.

I also like that mushrooms are now sculpted as part of the bases, as its something I used to have to create using
Greenstuff. This is incorporated really well into the goblins, with mushrooms growing on them and even using a big
one as some bagpipes. One goblin is even trying to break free out of the jaws of a particularly ravenous squig! All
I want is more, more boxes with more poses. I want loads of these guys.
