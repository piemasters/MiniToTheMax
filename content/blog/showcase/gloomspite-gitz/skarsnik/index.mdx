## Miniature Review

Back in the day I started collecting Orcs and Goblins largely due to the original Skarsnik and Gobbla miniature.
I loved squigs, and he was by far the biggest at the time. It makes me really happy that they redesigned the miniature,
even if they've dropped the character name.

As squigs have since grown in size, they've made Gobbla truly huge to ensure he stands out on the battlefield. I love
the huge tongue as it gives him a lot of character and makes him look a lot more ferocious than the other more comedic
squigs.

Skarsnik's hat has also grown and having him stood on a rock gives him the height to make him still look in
control of this beast of a squig. The smaller snotling also helps to make Skarsnik appear larger than he really is.

There's a few little details on him like a moon potion and sickle, but sadly not to the level of Skragrott. I guess
this is due to him being an older miniature from the finecast days. Overall though I'm still really happy that he's been
given a new life and can be at the centre of my Gloomspite army.

## Roundup

I'm really happy with how he's come out. I used a lot more colours and a much longer process than I normally would,
but as a centrepiece it really makes him stand out from the rest. I wouldn't paint infantry this way, but will at least
take forward some techniques used in the future for other characters.
