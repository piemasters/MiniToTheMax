## Miniature Review

Along with Skragrott and the contrast paints I also bought Throgg. It was announced that he was being discontinued, and
I had always wanted him to lead my Gloomspite Gitz into battle. Technically he's part of the Warriors of Chaos Fantasy
army, before Age of Sigmar was released. That doesn't stop me using him as a Troggoth King right?

Thankfully he's not really descended that far into Chaos, other than an extra mouth here or there. I really love his
pose and just how huge he is, with his massive clock and rock-solid hammer. He's also got that level of humour too him
that's common in the Gloomspite Gitz range, like the axes used to hold his cloak on, and the tongues coming out of his
various mouths.

I think he'll add a lot of height to the army, and it'll be interesting to compare him to the new Troggoth range once
I get around to buying some.

## Painting Techniques

### Skin
1. Base: Tallarn Sand
2. Shade: Seraphim Sepia
3. Shade: Agrax Earthshade
4. Layer: Tallarn Sand
5. Layer: Zandri Dust
6. Layer: Karak Stone
7. Layer: Rakarth Flesh
8. Layer: Morghast Bone
9. Layer: Ushabti Bone

### Scales
1. Base: Abaddon Black
2. Layer: Skavenblight Dinge
3. Layer: Eshin Grey
4. Layer: Dark Reaper
5. Layer: Dawnstone
6. Dry: Mechanicus Standard Grey
7. Dry:Administratum Grey

### Cloak (Red)
1. Base: Khorne Red
2. Layer: Mephiston Red
3. Layer: Evil Sunz Scarlet
4. Shade: Agrax Earthshade
5. Layer: Mephiston Red
6. Layer: Evil Sunz Scarlet

### Robe (Checked)
1. Base: Corax White

3. Layer: Abaddon Black
4. Layer: Eshin Grey (thin line along 2 edges of each square)

After step 2 I drew lines vertically, then horizontally lightly with a pencil to get the checkerboard design. That
made the next steps a lot easier rather than trying to freehand.

## Basing
Just as with Skragrott I started by adding a thick layer of Stirland Battlemire, then applied a shade of
Agrax Earthshade and a drybrush of Tallarn Sand. I then applied some Citadel Scorched Grass in patches as well as some
[Leaf Litter](http://www.greenstuffworld.com/en/model-leaves/277-leaf-scatter-litter-natural-leaves.html). Finally, I
painted around the edge of the base with Mournfang Brown, then Mournfang Brown.

## Roundup

I really love how he turned out. I'm really happy with how smooth the skin turned out, it was almost worth it after
applying so many layers! The robe also adds a lot of brightness to an otherwise quite dull colour scheme. I was tempted
to go with black to help tie him in but thought it would make him too dark and not stand out enough on the battlefield.

The checks didn't quite come out as sharp as I wanted, looking a bit wobbly in areas, but still not bad for a first
attempt. From a distance it still looks great and ties him nicely into the rest of the army.

Now that he's done that's all the Gloomspite Gitz I have ready for painting for now, so I think I'll go back to Space
Wolves for a few weeks!
