## Miniature Review

I've had this around a while, back when I bought a load of Forgeworld fantasy stuff up before they discontinued it all.
I mainly bought it for its size, as I didn't really think it had much detail on it until looking at it now. It's covered
in sculpted moss, dirt, icons, mushrooms, skulls and shields so far from a simple grey paint job.

I've had an orc and goblin army for over 30 years and although I love the sculpts they do look dated now so I don't
think I'll ever include them as units in a main army. I have started to fit them into the army as base additions, like
the old fanatics on my Mangler Squig bases. To help make the Rogue Idol look massive I've surrounded it with a few bases
worth of 1980s Snotlings. I love all the faces and poses on these guys, they're a lot like Nurglings are now, and they
give the final piece a lot more life and fun.

## Roundup

I made use of the airbrush a lot more for both the Idol and the Snotlings and it turned out to be a great time saver.
A wash and a couple of quick drybrushes and it was looking mostly done. I ended up covering a lot of the moss with
tufts, which I think gives it a lot more variation and added color. Painting the icons with a single contrast layer
looks great as the stone shows through making it look natural.

The Snotlings also came out pretty great for only a few layers. I didn't want to spend too long on them as this was
meant to be a quick piece and I'd already found far more detail to paint than I was expecting. They add so much to the
miniature that it's easily now one of my favorite pieces.
