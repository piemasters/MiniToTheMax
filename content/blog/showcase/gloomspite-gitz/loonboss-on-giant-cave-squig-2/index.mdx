## Miniature Review

Taking a break from the Stampeding Squigalanche box set, I managed to pickup the OOP Forgeworld Night Goblin Command
Set. That means another Loonbosses on Giant Cave Squig!

I've always wanted this miniature, but put off buying it until I started my Gloomspite army back off again.
When I said I wasn't fully happy with the shape of the Games Workshop Cave Squig, this is how I picture they should be.
Much more squat and round but still with a lot of teeth and claws.

The armour on the squig is great and really makes it stand out from the rest of the army. It doesn't have the most
detail, but it is covered in dents and scratches that makes it much more interesting than simple flat panels. The
eyebrow panels are a great idea and help give the squig a lot more character.

The only part of the mini I don't love is the grot on top. I think the proportions maybe aren't quite the same as the
new range so he has quite a long face and is fairly simply equipped. I much prefer the armoured grot on the newer
Cave Squig.

### Squig Skin

## Roundup

I tried not to spend too much time on this one, largely just trying to blow through the steps I've picked up from
batch painting the larger box set. I really love how the skin came out and the armour looks pretty good, worn and
dirty just like you'd expect with lots of shiny scratches. It's great that the two Loonbosses match on colorscheme
but still look totally different.
