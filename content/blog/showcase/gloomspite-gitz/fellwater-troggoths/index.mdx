## Painting Techniques

### Skin

<Paint name={'Militarum Green'} />
<Paint name={'Mantis Warriors Green'} />
<Paint name={'Plaguebearer Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Coelia Greenshade'} />
<Paint name={'Garaghaks Sewer'} />
<Paint name={'Yriel Yellow'} />
<Paint name={'Lugganath Orange'} />
<Paint name={'Astorath Red'} />

To start I painted each troll a different base color. One was Militarum Green, one Mantis Warriors Green and the last
Plaguebearer Flesh. This helped give them some variety, but after washes and highlights they all come together nicely.

I then applied a watered down mix of Coelia Greenshade and Garaghaks Sewer to each troll. This helped to bring out the
details and blends them together. The brown added to the green gives them a muddier look which fits the swampy theme.

I then drybrushed highlights onto the skin. Starting with Yriel Yellow, then Lugganath Orange and finally Astorath Red
on areas like the knuckles, nose, lips and bum.

### Scales

<Paint name={'Dark Angels Green'} />
<Paint name={'Coelia Greenshade'} />
<Paint name={'Garaghaks Sewer'} />
<Paint name={'Niblet Green'} />
<Paint name={'Hellion Green'} />

As with the skin the Coelia Greenshade and Garaghaks Sewer were watered down and mixed together and applied as an all
over wash. Garaghaks Sewer is a strong paint so make sure not to use too much of it as it will overpower the green.
Once dry I highlighted the scales with Niblet Green and then Hellion Green.
