## Miniature Review

I've never really collected Necromunda but I've always loved the different gangs and the terrain used in the game. It
seems great but I've always had too much on my plate to start a new game system. However, I saw the Ozostium miniature
and read some of the background lore, and when I saw that he was from before the Imperium with ties to the Dark Age of
Technology I was sold.

The miniature itself is fantastic, almost like a mini Emperor. I also love the colors used in the artwork, the gold
armour with the red cloth really stands out. The pose is great too, very regal and commanding. His sword has a unique
design too with the hollow center. The Caryatid servitor is a nice touch too, adding something unique to the miniature.

## Painting Techniques

### Gold

<Paint name="Dark Rust" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="Parasite Brown" category="Vallejo Game Color" />
<Paint name="Ice Yellow" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="Sun Yellow" category="Vallejo Game Color" />
<Paint name="Ice Yellow" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="White" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="Black" category="Vallejo Model Color" />

I followed the tutorial for NMM gold by Squidmar [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw1EqtTyVpA). Largely mixing the
previous colors into the next color up to Ice Yellow, then glazing Sun Yellow over the bright areas. The only difference
I made to the video was adding some white to the brightest highlights and black to the darkest shadows.

### Steel

<Paint name="Dark Sea Blue" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="Deck Tan" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="Ice Yellow" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="White" category="Vallejo Model Color" />

I followed the tutorial for NMM steel by Squidmar [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpqp8rIQuSM). For the sword I
added sme Blood for the Blood God to the tip.

### Skin

<Paint name="Burnt Red" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="Skin Tone" category="Vallejo Game Color" />
<Paint name="Carroburg Crimson" />
<Paint name="Druchii Violet" />

### Plasma

<Paint name="Kabalite Green" />
<Paint name="Moot Green" />
<Paint name="White" category="Vallejo Model Color" />

### Red Armour

<Paint name="Burnt Red" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="Flesh Tearers Red" />
<Paint name="Gory Red" category="Vallejo Game Color" />
<Paint name="Scarlet Blood" category="Vallejo Game Color" />
<Paint name="Hot Orange" category="Vallejo Game Color" />

### Cloth

<Paint name="Gal Vorbak Red" category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name="Word Bearers Red" category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name="Khorne Red" category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name="Mephiston Red" category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name="Evil Sunz Scarlet" category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name="Scarlet Blood" category="Vallejo Game Color" />
<Paint name="Ice Yellow" category="Vallejo Model Color" />

I used the airbrush to apply the reds from a tighter and tighter angle from one direction to create a gradient. This
kept the darker tones in the correct areas the shadows would be and ensured the highlights were placed correctly.
Finally I mixed some Ice Yellow into Scarlet Blood and applied that to the very brightest areas.

### Gems

<Paint name="Gory Red" category="Vallejo Game Color" />
<Paint name="Scarlet Blood" category="Vallejo Game Color" />
<Paint name="Hot Orange" category="Vallejo Game Color" />
<Paint name="White" category="Vallejo Model Color" />

### Eyes

<Paint name="Blue Green" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="White" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="Scarlet Blood" category="Vallejo Game Color" />
<Paint name="White" category="Vallejo Model Color" />

I ended up not fully happy with the face and put the mask back on, but the eyes were done before that.

### Teeth

<Paint name="Deck Tan" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="White" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="Aggaros Dunes" />

## Basing

### Floor

<Paint name="Dark Rust" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="Sotek Green" />
<Paint name="Kabalite Green" />
<Paint name="Sybarite Green" />
<Paint name="Gauss Blaster Green" />
<Paint name="Terradon Turquoise" />
<Paint name="Black" category="Vallejo Model Color" />

I found that the floor, although looked really cool, was far too bright for the overall piece. This is why at the end
I glazed over Terradon Turquoise with a small amount of black to tone it back down.

### Wall

<Paint name="Gorthor Brown" />
<Paint name="Baneblade Brown" />
<Paint name="Aggaros Dunes" />

### Bronze

<Paint name="Dark Rust" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="Parasite Brown" category="Vallejo Game Color" />
<Paint name="Ice Yellow" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="White" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="Coelia Greenshade" />
<Paint name="Nihilakh Oxide" />

### Steel

<Paint name="Deck Tan" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="Ice Yellow" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="White" category="Vallejo Model Color" />

I used Nurgles Rot around the pipes.

## Weathering Chips

<Paint name="Fire Dragon Bright" />
<Paint name="Phalanx Yellow" />

### Statue

<Paint name="Black" category="Vallejo Model Color" />

I slowly mixed in more and more white to create an overall grey color.

<Paint name="Pink Horror" />
<Paint name="Volupus Pink" />
<Paint name="Pink Horror" />

<Paint name="Morghast Bone" />
<Paint name="Ushabti Bone" />
<Paint name="Aggaros Dunes" />

### Skulls

<Paint name="Morghast Bone" />
<Paint name="Ushabti Bone" />
<Paint name="Aggaros Dunes" />
<Paint name="Ushabti Bone" />
<Paint name="White" category="Vallejo Model Color" />

### Candles

<Paint name="White" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="Dreadful Visage" />
<Paint name="White" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="Flash Gitz Yellow" />
<Paint name="Hot Orange" category="Vallejo Game Color" />
<Paint name="Scarlet Blood" category="Vallejo Game Color" />
<Paint name="Black" category="Vallejo Model Color" />

Once everything was painted I then applied a number of weathering powders all over the piece. I used the
[Gamers Grass Core Basing Pigments Set](https://gamersgrass.com/product/basing-pigments-core-set/) which has a great
range of colors. I used:

- Green Lichen, Brown Earth and Charcoal on the walls
- Red Iron, Light Rust and Dry Earth on the floor and his cloak

## Roundup

I'm really happy with how everything turned out. It's the first time I've really tried out NMM and there was a huge
amount of metal on both the miniature and the base. The shapes of the miniature were really difficult to figure out
how the lighting would work, and being almost entirely gold there's no way to hide it if it goes wrong.

It's also the first time I've created a larger diorama style base like this, and I think it looks great. It's almost
put me off painting regular miniatures, instead focusing on larger display pieces like this. I think it is something I
will look to do again in the future, but for now I need a bit of a break as it was a lot of work!
