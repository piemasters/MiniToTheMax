## Miniature Review

Bazdrogg was the first Warhammer+ subscription model and although I don't really collect Ironjawz I would like to pick
some up in the future and he seemed like such a great miniature I didn't want to miss out. He's super chunky with
massive plate armour and of course you can't miss his giant axe!

There's some great detail on the miniature, with a number of bones and horns attached to the armour, as well as the
Stormcast helmets and other trinkets. I think the greatest part of the miniature is the expression and the huge amount
of detail in the face.

As a cherry topper I decided to add a snail for a bit of fun and to tie him into my Gloomspite Gitz army and I'm really
happy with the look and the sense of scale it helps bring him.

The bases were applied with some Stirland Mud, then painted with some greys and browns for the dirt and rock.
Once painted a number of tufts were applied, then finished off with some water effects.

## Roundup

I've not painted much yellow armour before and I was a bit worried that yellow isn't always the easiest color to fix
when you make mistakes. The use of the contrast paint has come out a bit patchy, but I really like it as it makes the
armour look heavily weathered which is what I wanted to go for.

I was also going for a bit of a different tone for the skin that what I've done for the Kruleboyz, I think I made it
a bit brighter in the end that what I was aiming for, but I do like how well it helps the face stand out from the rest
of the miniature so I wouldn't change it.
