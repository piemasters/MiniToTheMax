With the full Dusk Till Dawn set now painted, I can finally show off all the miniatures together! The set looks great
together with so much fun an character and the way I painted and based them makes it really easy to see who belongs to
each faction.

The contents of the box is quite light, but I appreciate it's nice and small and looks fairly simple to pick up and
play. There's only a handful of rules and each character has its own card that details its stats and abilities,
meaning there's not lots of rule book referencing to do.

Now I just need to put a board together and get some games in! Maybe I'll pickup the full rule book as well to get
some more of the lore and background on the world.
