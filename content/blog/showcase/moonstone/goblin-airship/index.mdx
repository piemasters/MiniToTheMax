## Miniature Review

I think the Goblin Airship is my favorite miniature in the whole Moonstone range and is what got me into the game. I
love frogs and having one puffed up and used as a balloon is just brilliant. The bulging eyes are amazing and I love
how the front feet are sticking out, along with the curled tongue.

The goblin pilot is also great and I love how he has a whole home setup underneath with his curtains and cup of coffee
sat next to him. The pea shooter is a really fun touch too, adding to the whimsical nature of the piece.

Ice Yellow was mixed with Magenta to create a gradient effect on the webbed feet and tongue. White was used as a final
highlight for the spots.

### Eyes

<Paint name="White" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="Magenta" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="White" category="Vallejo Model Color" />

Once the whole eye was painted white, I added a magenta glaze thinly over the entire thing. Then to give it an even more
blood shot look I added more and more layers of magenta to the corners of the eyes, letting it fade out towards the
center. I then went back over some areas with pure white to bring back the brightness.

### Pupil

<Paint name="Black" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="Dark Sea Blue" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="White" category="Vallejo Model Color" />

I painted the pupil black first, then added a smaller dark sea blue ring inside that. I used white to mix with the blue
to create a highlight spot on the pupil. I finally went in with pure white to add a small dot of light reflection. The
whole eye was then gloss varnished to give it a wet look.

I started by using the mud texture to create a slightly uneven ground on the base and added some rocks while it was
still wet so they sunk into the ground. Once dry I applied a layer of the New Zealand fields flock over the top to give
it a grassy, rocky look. I then applied a range of tufts and flowers.

## Roundup

I think the frog came out great, I love how vibrant he is and how much character I was able to bring out with the
eyes. The pilot contrasts nicely and the pink really helps to tie it with the rest of the goblin force.
