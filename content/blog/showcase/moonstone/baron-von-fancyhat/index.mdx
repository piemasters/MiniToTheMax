## Miniature Review

In the Dusk Till Dawn set for Moonstone, Baron Von Fancyhat seems to be the leader of the group. With his extravagant
hat and confident pose, he certainly looks the part. The detail on the miniature is really nice, especially for just
how thin he is and how small a lot of the features are.

The hat and the pose really make the miniature, along with the expression on his face that adds a lot of fun to the
character. I also love the long boots, it makes him almost clown-like and adds to the fun of the piece.

To create the base I applied the vaseline to the rolling pin and worktop, then used the rolling pin on the milliput to
create a large area of stone flooring. Doing a large batch with all the miniatures cut off their bases, I used the round
cutters to cut the perfect size for each, then pushed them flat onto each base while wet to create a strong bond and
ensure they went on flat.

The Scratch Brush Pens can be used to clean the rolling pin, to ensure detail isn't lost for its next use.

Once dry I sprayed them all black then applied the following colors:

<Paint name={'Dawnstone'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Praxeti White'} category="Citadel Dry" />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Gutrippa Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />

The Gutrippa Flesh was applied in the recesses and in some patches to resemble moss. Once painting was finished I went
over those areas with the grass flock to finish them off.

Note if you try to glue a miniature to a completed base the bond will be very weak due to paint peeling away from the
milliput very easily. You need to scratch away some of the paint from the base where they join to ensure a strong bond.

## Roundup

I want to create a theme for each faction in the game. For the Commonwealth I want green to be the primary color and
the bases to be stone flooring with grass growing through the cracks. This will help make it obvious on the table which
faction each miniature belongs to.

I think the armour came out well and the green works well with the white feathers and gold trim. The face came out
fairly well, but it maybe looks a bit flat. It's really difficult at this scale where the details are so tiny.
