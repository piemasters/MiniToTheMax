> Flintlock is an ice cold ranged killer, but he's saving up for a new jacket to fix part of that.

## Miniature Review

While Baron Von Fancyhat is all show, Flintlock is all business. His gear is much more practical and worn down, showing
he's had a lot of field experience. Despite being a fairly simple miniature, there are so many different textures and
details sculpted into his clothes. He's got a somewhat interesting pose too, partly crouched on a rock with his rifle
secured by a pole, looking down the barrel ready to shoot.

### Steel

<Paint name="Dark Gunmetal" category="Vallejo Game Color" />
<Paint name="Silver" category="Vallejo Game Color" />

Rather than the Tyran Blue for the pole I used some browns to give it an older and more beaten up look.

To create the base I applied the vaseline to the rolling pin and worktop, then used the rolling pin on the milliput to
create a large area of stone flooring. Doing a large batch with all the miniatures cut off their bases, I used the round
cutters to cut the perfect size for each, then pushed them flat onto each base while wet to create a strong bond and
ensure they went on flat.

The Scratch Brush Pens can be used to clean the rolling pin, to ensure detail isn't lost for its next use.

Once dry I sprayed them all black then applied the following colors:

<Paint name={'Dawnstone'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Praxeti White'} category="Citadel Dry" />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Gutrippa Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />

The Gutrippa Flesh was applied in the recesses and in some patches to resemble moss. Once painting was finished I went
over those areas with the grass flock to finish them off.

Note if you try to glue a miniature to a completed base the bond will be very weak due to paint peeling away from the
milliput very easily. You need to scratch away some of the paint from the base where they join to ensure a strong bond.

## Roundup

Flintlock was more difficult to paint than expected as there's a lot of small details around his torso which were
tricky to reach because of the pose. However, I think it came out well and the different textures on his clothes really
help to make what could otherwise be a bit of a boring miniature more interesting.
