> Beaky Bobby is the most reliable goblin healer in Tauber. Yes I know that isn't a high bar.

## Miniature Review

Beaky Bobby really stands out with his plague doctor mask and open coat filled with various potions and remedies. The
amount of detail is really nice, with all the bottles, the feathers and the staff with jewel in the center.

The fun comes from the duel sense of the pose, is he showing you his wares or is he flashing you, as the only thing he
has on under the coat is a loincloth. The older looking body and the long ears add to the character of the miniature.

## Painting Techniques

### Skin

<Paint name="Cayman Green" category="Vallejo Game Color" />
<Paint name="Scorpy Green" category="Vallejo Game Color" />
<Paint name="Lime Green" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="White" category="Vallejo Model Color" />

I used more white than usual when mixing colors to desaturate the green to make it appear older and less vibrant.

### Leather

<Paint name="Dark Rust" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="Parasite Brown" category="Vallejo Game Color" />
<Paint name="Ice Yellow" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="Ivory" category="Vallejo Model Color" />

For some of the leather I mixed in different amounts of Ice Yellow and Ivory to create varying tones.

### Feathers & Cloth

<Paint name="Druchii Violet" />
<Paint name="Magenta" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="Ice Yellow" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="White" category="Vallejo Model Color" />

I mixed Magenta with more and more Ice Yellow and White to create a gradient effect on the feathers.

### Steel

<Paint name="Dark Gunmetal" category="Vallejo Game Color" />
<Paint name="Silver" category="Vallejo Game Color" />
<Paint name="Tyran Blue" />

### Wood

<Paint name="Dark Fleshtone" category="Vallejo Game Color" />

<Paint name="Lime Green" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="Yellow Green" category="Vallejo Model Color" />

I started by using the mud texture to create a slightly uneven ground on the base and added some rocks while it was
still wet so they sunk into the ground. Once dry I applied a layer of the New Zealand fields flock over the top to give
it a grassy, rocky look. I then applied a range of tufts and flowers.

## Roundup

For the Dominion faction in Moonstone I want to use purple as the primary color, and give them really colorful grassy
bases. The goblins are always the most fun so I wanted the bases to match their personality.

Although the leather looks a but rough I really like the color and it gives him some personality. I went with duller
skin tones than I normally would to give him an older look. All the potions gave me a lot of opportunity to use bright
colors and overall he's a really interesting looking piece.
