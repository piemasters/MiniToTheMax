## Miniature Review

Grub is a funny one, part Goblin, part bug and 100% wizard. I love all the extra eyes and I love the beak. With the
addition of the wings, the fur and the tortoise shell body there's so much going on with this small miniature.

The additional 2 arms helps bring out his bug like form, although it might have been nice for him to hold some extra
magic items or a staff to help show off his wizardry. I also love the pointed hat and the droopy ears as it gives him
a really nice silhouette.

<Paint name="Dark Gunmetal" category="Vallejo Game Color" />

I started by painting the whole area silver, then transitioned downwards into dark gunmetal. I then mixed silver and
blue green on the one side, and silver and magenta on the other side to give a slight iridescent effect. This was added
thinly to keep the dark transition towards the bottom of the wings.

I started by using the mud texture to create a slightly uneven ground on the base and added some rocks while it was
still wet so they sunk into the ground. Once dry I applied a layer of the New Zealand fields flock over the top to give
it a grassy, rocky look. I then applied a range of tufts and flowers.

## Roundup

I think he came out looking great. The purple hat contrasts nicely with the green skin and the brown tortoise shell body
helps blend everything together. The extra eyes really help to give him character, adding some extra vibrancy. The
wings also came out nicely, a realistic metallic bug like color.
