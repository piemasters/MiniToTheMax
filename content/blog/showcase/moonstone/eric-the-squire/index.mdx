## Miniature Review

In the Dusk Till Dawn set for Moonstone, Eric The Squire is the eager young apprentice to Baron Von Fancyhat. I love
his super enthusiastic face, it really captures the character well. It's also a great detail that while carrying
Fancyhat's sword, Eric is also holding a wooden practice sword so isn't trusted to even handle a real weapon yet.

I painted most of the leather textures different shades of brown to give them some variety, but all were painted using
a combination of the above colors. I went for a redder brown for the straps and pouches, and a lighter tan brown for the
jacket.

### Hair

I mixed each color into the next in varying amounts to create a smooth gradient.

To create the base I applied the vaseline to the rolling pin and worktop, then used the rolling pin on the milliput to
create a large area of stone flooring. Doing a large batch with all the miniatures cut off their bases, I used the round
cutters to cut the perfect size for each, then pushed them flat onto each base while wet to create a strong bond and
ensure they went on flat.

The Scratch Brush Pens can be used to clean the rolling pin, to ensure detail isn't lost for its next use.

Once dry I sprayed them all black then applied the following colors:

<Paint name={'Dawnstone'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Praxeti White'} category="Citadel Dry" />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Gutrippa Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />

The Gutrippa Flesh was applied in the recesses and in some patches to resemble moss. Once painting was finished I went
over those areas with the grass flock to finish them off.

Note if you try to glue a miniature to a completed base the bond will be very weak due to paint peeling away from the
milliput very easily. You need to scratch away some of the paint from the base where they join to ensure a strong bond.

## Roundup

I think Eric came out really well, and I love the bright colors used for his outfit. The green works really well as
a bright contrast to the dull brown than makes up a lot of his clothes and straps. His yellow hair also really helps
draw your eye to his face which is the real focal point of the miniature.
