## Miniature Review

Vicious Syd is a little goblin in a lot of plate mail. You can see part of his face showing through the visor of his
helmet, and a bit of leg below but that's about it. The only real points of interest are the badge on his chest and the
severed hand attached to his back. He's a fairly simple one, but I do like the idea of a goblin soldier decked out in
heavy armor pretending to be a knight, rather than being stuck with odd scraps like most others.

I started by using the mud texture to create a slightly uneven ground on the base and added some rocks while it was
still wet so they sunk into the ground. Once dry I applied a layer of the New Zealand fields flock over the top to give
it a grassy, rocky look. I then applied a range of tufts and flowers.

## Roundup

I wanted a nice clean look for Vicious Syd to contrast how I would normally paint goblins. It's a fairly simple look,
but I do like how it turned out. Once again the pink helps to add a bit more vibrance and interest, as does the blue
tint to the armour.
