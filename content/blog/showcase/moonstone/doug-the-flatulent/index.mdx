## Miniature Review

Doug is my favorite miniature from the Dusk Till Dawn set for Moonstone. Pugs are great and the big bug eyes add so
much character to the piece. The goblin sat on top is heavily armoured with a breastplate, helmet and shield that
give him a knightly look, but cover most of his face other than a big toothy grin poking out from under the helmet.

## Painting Techniques

### Skin

<Paint name="Lime Green" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="Ice Yellow" category="Vallejo Model Color" />
<Paint name="Magenta Ink" category="Vallejo Game Color" />

Ice Yellow was mixed with Lime Green for the final highlights. The Magenta Ink was used around the lips.

### Leather

For some of the leather I mixed in different amounts of Ivory to create varying tones.

<Paint name="Magenta" category="Vallejo Model Color" />

I mixed Magenta with more and more Ice Yellow and White to create a gradient effect on the feathers.

I started by using the mud texture to create a slightly uneven ground on the base and added some rocks while it was
still wet so they sunk into the ground. Once dry I applied a layer of the New Zealand fields flock over the top to give
it a grassy, rocky look. I then applied a range of tufts and flowers.

## Roundup

The pug came out great and I'm really happy with the eyes, they really were the make or break part of the miniature.
I also went with a coppery gold for the armour which I think works well with the green skin of the goblin and stops the
whole thing becoming too silver. The small freehand on the shield also came out ok in the end, being difficult to do
on the uneven surface.
