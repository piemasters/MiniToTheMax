## Miniature Review

Friar Flavious is a beast of a man, he certainly receives a lot of donations! His legs look like they can barely hold
him, and his belly makes up the majority of the miniature. He holds a fairly simply weapon, and keeps a book at his
side, but beyond that he has very light mail armour, a codpiece and a cape.

## Painting Techniques

### Steel

<Paint name="Dark Gunmetal" category="Vallejo Game Color" />
<Paint name="Silver" category="Vallejo Game Color" />
<Paint name="Tyran Blue" />

Rather than the Tyran Blue for the pole I used some browns to give it an older and more beaten up look.

### Gold

<Paint name="Reikland Fleshshade" />

The boots and hat were kept darker, while the gloves, belt, straps and bags had more Parasite Brown added to give them
a more reddish vibrance.

To create the base I applied the vaseline to the rolling pin and worktop, then used the rolling pin on the milliput to
create a large area of stone flooring. Doing a large batch with all the miniatures cut off their bases, I used the round
cutters to cut the perfect size for each, then pushed them flat onto each base while wet to create a strong bond and
ensure they went on flat.

The Scratch Brush Pens can be used to clean the rolling pin, to ensure detail isn't lost for its next use.

Once dry I sprayed them all black then applied the following colors:

<Paint name={'Dawnstone'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Praxeti White'} category="Citadel Dry" />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Gutrippa Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />

The Gutrippa Flesh was applied in the recesses and in some patches to resemble moss. Once painting was finished I went
over those areas with the grass flock to finish them off.

Note if you try to glue a miniature to a completed base the bond will be very weak due to paint peeling away from the
milliput very easily. You need to scratch away some of the paint from the base where they join to ensure a strong bond.

## Roundup

When I look at certain areas of the skin I think it looks good, but overall it doesn't look quite right. I think I
went too vibrant to the point it doesn't look natural enough. I think it's down to being such a large area of skin
it makes the miniature too bright.

Looking back at the photo I really need to add some matte varnish around the face to reduce the shine as it makes him
look more messy and you lose some of the nice details.
