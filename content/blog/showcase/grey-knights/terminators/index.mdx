So yet another squad is ticked off. This time it's a smaller squad, a 5 man Terminator Squad updated from its original
paint job 11 years ago. These terminators are almost the last of my older metal models painted, which is a relief as
they are definitely that much harder to paint as the paint rubs off very easily.

The sculpts themselves still look great, even compared to today's standards. They are the models that originally got
me onto Grey Knights from my original Space Wolf and Orc army. Over 10 years later I've been drawn back to them.

Hereâ€™s a photo of how they looked like before:

To be fair, other than the terrible old style bases the paint job on them, considering I was around 12, wasn't too
bad. The paint scheme wasn't too far off my current scheme, my new scheme just has a larger focus on shading and
highlighting.

Hopefully you'll agree that these terminators have received a considerable upgrade! I've tried two different styles
of photography, let me know in the comments below which you prefer!
