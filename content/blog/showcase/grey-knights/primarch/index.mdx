So here is Grand Master **Valdar Aurikon**.

> Valdar Aurikon commands the 3rd Brotherhood as **Warden of the Librarius**, in effect acting as the Chapter's [Chief Librarian](http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Chief_Librarian 'Chief Librarian'), in that he has command and control of the Librarius. Arvann Stern acts as the brotherhood's Brother-Captain. The 3rd Brotherhood has always held a place of honour within the Chapter. It was, according to legend, Janus' own Brotherhood, and throughout the long history of the Grey Knights it has fostered many of the Chapter’s greatest heroes. [Kaldor Draigo](http://warhammer40k.wikia.com/wiki/Kaldor_Draigo 'Kaldor Draigo') was Brother-Captain and then Grand Master of the 3rd Brotherhood, with Arvann Stern following in the Supreme Grand Master's footsteps. With a reputation for glory, the 3rd has also borne the attentions of some of the Grey Knights’ greatest foes. Many times during its history the 3rd Brotherhood has come close to extinction, daemonic adversaries seeking vengeance for the actions of its current Brother-Captain or Grand Master.

## The Miniature

Although I use him as the Grand Master of my Grey Knight Brotherhood, he is easily Primarch size and could be used as such. However, Grey Knight’s aren't known to have a Primarch, however I don't believe it would be too inconceivable that one of the final acts of the Emperor before taking his place on the Golden Throne was to create a a 21st Primarch while Malcador the Sigilite formed the rest of the Grey Knights, as all Grey Knights are rumoured to share the same DNA as the Emperor  himself.  Another alternative could be that one of the two Primarchs from the lost chapters could have been recruited for the role to lead the Grey Knights as redemption for their past crimes.

The model itself can be found [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20140613143056/http://sciborminiatures.com/en_,shop.php?art=1464 '28mm SF Archangel #2') from Scibor Miniatures. The company makes so many great miniatures and the quality and range has continued to increase over the years. It is really worth checking them out!

## Conversion

The only real conversion I made was cutting up a storm bolter to fit onto the arm relatively tightly, and the addition of the shield with personal heraldry. On the breastplate you’ll notice on Scibor’s website there is a chalice. This made the model look like a Blood Angel (as do the wings), so I cut notches into it to represent the Inquisitorial I.

## Painting

I had a lot of trouble with the wings. I painted them the traditional bleached white originally, but they made him look too much like a Blood Angel. I couldn't think of a colour that would fit well with Grey Knights. Red, white, gold and blue are the main colours, but none looked quite right.

What drew me to purple is a new effect I've started using. A purple wash on red and bronze gives a really nice effect. It's a lot more subtle than Agrax Earthshade, yet gives a really soft shadow blend on reds and a really nice tint on bronze. The purple also matches Arvann Stern's sword, tying the two together nicely as

The wings can be taken off, as well as the red cloth on his waist, and he can be removed from his base, which allows for easy transportation. The wings are attached via a magnet and paper-clip (used as pinning material) to stop the wait twisting the magnet. The rest are just pinned tightly enough so that nothing really wobbles.

## The Base

For the base I attempted a new technique for lava, building up thick layers of tinted PVA glue to give a layer effect. In the end I didn't feel this worked, as it gives a translucent appearance that lava doesn't have. It did create a nice texture for flowing lava though, which I painted over the top of using another new technique.

I painted the darkest red closest to the rocks and the edge of the base. I then mixed that with a lighter red and painted another think line slightly overlapping out from the rocks, blending in with the first. I continued to repeat this, moving up to oranges and yellows. This way there should be a few thin spots left uncovered which were then painted white.

I also used weathering powders for the first time. I created the mud areas on the base by mixing Forge World’s Fresh Mud with PVA glue and splodged it on, followed by Dried Mud and Dark Sand. I think the effect came out pretty well. I also rubbed the powder directing onto certain areas, creating stained dirty patches that make it look more natural.

## Conclusion

Overall I'm happy with the effect and looking forward to using him in a game as he’ll easily dominate the table in most games.

Got and ideas for improvements? Leave a comment, it would be really appreciated! Here are some more pics as always:
