## Miniature Review

When I painted my last unit of Grey Knight Terminators it was back in 2012, and that was upgrading the paint job I'd
done 10 years previously. So in 20 years I've managed 2 units of Terminators! The original 1980s Rogue Trader Grey
Knight Terminators are what really got me into Warhammer, so these are some of my favorite miniatures.

I really need to finish off the army, there's only a handful left after this unit. Saying that, I'm sure there's going
to be new miniatures coming out soon with 10th edition and the new Terminators being released, as far as I'm aware
there still aren't any Primaris Grey Knights other than the new Castellan Crowe.

I love the helmet design, the enscriptions across the pauldrons and the rest of the armour, and of course the Nemesis
Force Weapons. There's so many intricate details that each could easily be a named character for another legion.
They're futuristic super bulky knights, the elite of the elite, and make all other Space Marines seem inferior in
comparison.

## Roundup

Overall I'm hapy with how they look, although I'm not 100% happy with the armour highlights. I find silver really
difficult to look right, and I'm not a fan of most of Games Workship silver paints. I find most seperate and apply
too thinly or don't apply evenly. I like Leadbelcher and Grey Knights Steel but might need to look elsewhere for some
lighter colors.

It was interesting to see how the force blades turned out compared to 10 years ago. I think I've got the transitions
looking a bit smoother now, although it reminded me why I stopped painting them, it takes forever! I'll have to have
a go with the airbrush at some point in the future, once I've had a bit more practice with it.
