> Swampcalla Shamans act as advisors to the Killabosses and spiritual leaders of Kruleboyz society. They often
> accompany the bosses during raids where they are found whispering the will of Mork to the boss's ears. However,
> they are not only advisors but also powerful wizards who harness the power of the Waaagh! to cast spells and brew
> various elixirs alongside their pot-grots.

## Miniature Review

The Swampcalla Shaman reminds me a bit of the old Orc shamans, but a lot taller. The long flowing robes adds depth
to the miniatures and the huge skull on its back makes it really unique. The pouring of the potion is a really nice
touch and something that you'd never see years ago.

The Pot Grot has a surprising amount of detail, although its a bit of a shame that it's mostly all on his back. There's
a number of bags, plants, pans, bottles and even a bird foot.

## Roundup

I wasn't sure if painting all the robes purple would be too much, but with the various details it prevents all the other
colors becoming too much. The Pot Grot works as a great pairing, with the potion really tying the two together well.
