## Miniature Review

The Marshcrawla Sloggoth is a bit of a weird one, it's no the most imposing monster but it does fit in really well with
the swamp-like feel of the Kruleboyz. As it's purely manned by Hobgrots it's to be expected, but with the platform and
various chains the miniature as a whole does compare in size to others in the army.

The crew with their Snatcha-stikks do really make the model, adding a lot of character. I decided to attach the nets
the platform rather than leave them out, as it helps tell the story of how they catch their prey.

## Painting Techniques

### Sloggoth Skin

<Paint name={'Dryad Bark'} />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />
<Paint name={'XV88'} />
<Paint name={'Deathclaw Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Tau Light Ochre'} />
<Paint name={'Kislev Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Ulthuan Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Reikland Fleshshade'} />

I used the airbrush to apply these colors other than the wash, keeping the underneath darker and trying to highlight
the raised areas. Kislev Flesh and Ulthuan Grey were applied very thinly, then everything was washed with Reikland
Fleshshade.

### Hobgrot Skin

<Paint name={'Zandri Dust'} />
<Paint name={'Skeleton Horde'} />
<Paint name={'Lahmian Medium'} />
<Paint name={'Aggaros Dunes'} />
<Paint name={'Hobgrot Hide'} />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} />

A full Skeleton Horde shade was applied using Lahmian Medium 1:2, followed by a second recess shade of Aggaros Dunes.
It was then highlighted gradually from Hobgrot Hide to Ushabti Bone using mixes of the two paints to transition.

### Eyes

<Paint name={'Evil Sunz Scarlet'} />
<Paint name={'Fire Dragon Bright'} />

### Teeth

<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

### Cloth

<Paint name={'Naggaroth Night'} />
<Paint name={'Xereus Purple'} />
<Paint name={'Genestealer Purple'} />
<Paint name={'Shyish Purple'} />
<Paint name={'Russ Grey'} />

Shyish Purple was applied as a thinned glaze over the top to bring the brightness down. Russ Grey was used to highlight
the threads.

### Ropes

<Paint name={'Gore Grunta Fur'} />
<Paint name={'Snakebite Leather'} />
<Paint name={'Tallarn Sand'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

Gore Grunta Fur and Snakebite Leather were applied 1:1. Tallarn Sand was mixed 1:1 with Corax White as a final
highlight.

### Leather

<Paint name={'Cygor Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Basilicanum Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Gorthor Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Baneblade Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

Cygor Brown and Basilicanum Grey were applied 1:1. Baneblade Brown was mixed 1:1 with Corax White as a final highlight.

### Stone

<Paint name={'Space Wolves Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Basilicanum Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Fenrisian Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

Space Wolves Grey and Basilicanum Grey were applied 1:1, the shaded with pure Space Wolves Grey.

### Wood

<Paint name={'Wyldwood'} />
<Paint name={'Black Templar'} />
<Paint name={'Stormvermin Fur'} />
<Paint name={'Krieg Khaki'} />

Wyldwood and Black Templar were applied 1:1. Stormvermin Fur was mixed 2:1 with Krieg Khaki, then 1:1, then pure
Krieg Khaki as a final highlight.

### Steel

<Paint name={'Leadbelcher'} />
<Paint name={'Wyldwood'} />
<Paint name={'Black Templar'} />
<Paint name={'Contrast Medium'} />
<Paint name={'Leadbelcher'} />
<Paint name={'Stormhost Silver'} />

A wash of Wyldwood, Black Templar and Contrast Medium 1:1:2 was applied, then highlighted with Leadbelcher, then
a 1:1 of Leadbelcher and Stormhost Silver.

For the weapon tips I added some rust and poison:

<Paint name={'Ryza Rust'} />
<Paint name={'Warp Lightning'} />
<Paint name={'Nurgles Rot'} />

### Bronze

<Paint name={'Canoptek Alloy'} />
<Paint name={'Snakebite Leather'} />
<Paint name={'Contrast Medium'} />
<Paint name={'Canoptek Alloy'} />
<Paint name={'Stormhost Silver'} />

## Base

The base was built with cork board, then Stirland Mud was used to fill in the gaps. I then painted it up with some greys
and browns for the dirt and rock. Once painted a number of tufts were applied, then finished off with some water effects.

Finally I painted the outside of the base:

<Paint name={'Rhinox Hide'} />

## Roundup

I ended up messing up the airbrushing a bit with the skin. First I made him way too pale, then I darkened it down too
much and lost a lot of my layers, so I ended up doing the final highlights again with the brush. Other than that I was
surprised how quick it was to paint despite the size and all the pieces.

It ended up looking pretty good, maybe not as fleshy as I'd hoped, but maybe more like a big Hobgrot. It fits in well
with the army though so overall it's fine for now and lets me get started on the next big beasty!
