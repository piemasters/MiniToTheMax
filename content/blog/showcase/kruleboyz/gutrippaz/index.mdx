> Wielding an assortment of jagged spears and wickedly sharp hand weapons, the Gutrippaz are the mainstay of any
> Kruleboyz army. They march to battle in ramshackle phalanxes, their grinning skareshields looming out of the magical
> mists summoned by Swampcalla Shamans, scaring lesser opponents and dumb beasts away before battlelines even meet.

## Miniature Review

As I said in my Hobgrot post I bought a used set of Kruleboyz from the Dominion set, so I have the unit that is all
push to fit rather than from the box where you choose how to assemble them. I much prefer the spears over the other
weapons anyway and there's a good variety of helmets, armour and shield designs.

The shields are the whole reason I wanted to collect a small army in the first place, as they look great along with
my squigs. They have so much character with the big teeth and facial expressions, and stand out compared to their
otherwise low key armour.

## Roundup

I really rushed these, getting them almost completely done in just part of a day. I wanted to push myself to see if I
set a deadline like that how good or ugly will they turn out. When I look closely at one I can see it really isn't
great, but when looking at them as a group on display they look great. I'm not sure if I'm fully sold on the purple
cloaks with the orange shield, in my head I thought it'd look great, but maybe once I have more painted up it'll start
to work.
