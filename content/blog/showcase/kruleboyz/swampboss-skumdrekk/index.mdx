> Of all the Snatchabosses, Skumdrekk is the vilest and most kunnin'. As such, he has become a sort of celebrity to the
> Kruleboyz of Ghur. Owner of the Murkvast Menagerie - a huge, drained mangrove swamp that acts as prison for scores of
> vicious and unusual beasts - Swampboss Skumdrekk is a living legend. He rides into battle on his most prized conquest,
> Sloppklaw, the unusually fierce sludgeraker beast he turned to his will as a younger orruk.

## Miniature Review

Skumdrekk is possibly the main reason I wanted to start collecting Kruleboyz. I really like the big monsters and the
Sludgeraker has a really unique look, somewhere between a crocodile and a dinosaur.

The hanging robes look really good on the monster and helps it match well wit the rest of the army. The hanging cages
are also great, I really need to add some spare miniatures into them in the future!

## Painting Techniques

### Sludgeraker Skin

<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />
<Paint name={'XV88'} />
<Paint name={'Deathclaw Brown'} />

<Paint name={'Elysian Green'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Biel Tan Green'} />
<Paint name={'Elysian Green'} />
<Paint name={'Ogryn Camo'} />

I airbrushed a number of browns and greens on to create a varying look to the skin. I then applied a wash to bring
back the contrast, then used a few green colors to drybrush over everything to help bring everything together.

## Base

The base was built with cork board, then Stirland Mud was used to fill in the gaps. I then painted it up with some greys
and browns for the dirt and rock. Once painted a number of tufts were applied, then finished off with some water effects.

## Roundup

The skin maybe came out a bit brighter than I had wanted, but beyond that I think it came out great. I also finally got
the dirty down rust working well.

It turns out most of the pigment had clumped at the bottom and needed a file to clear it off the bottom then a long time
on the vortex mixer to really get it mixed fully together. After that rather than getting a gloss orange wash effect it
really started looking like rust and dried even better.
