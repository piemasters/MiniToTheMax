> This Swampcalla Shaman believes he's found a new way of observing the battlefield using a special seeing-eye rock,
> but it's really nothing more than a neat hat. Wearing a blindfold won't keep this malodorous mage from getting stuck
> in with a bogbark staff and he's brewing up a bevy of elixirs to empower the venom-tipped weapons of his fellow
> Kruleboyz. Mugruk isn't accompanied by a pot grot, but he can still jab at foes with his own backup stabba.

## Miniature Review

Mugruk was released as a promotional miniature for Events in 2022. Rather than the usual big standout miniature, they
went with a much smaller, blind shaman wearing what I'm convinced is some kind or tortoise shell. For a special event
miniature maybe I would have liked more, but there are some good features on him. The staff with a beast claw on the
end is pretty cool, especially breaking the ground apart. The tortoise shell also gives him a really unique shape and
on the large base you can easily tell he's a character in the army.

## Roundup

I wasn't fully sure how I wanted to paint him upfront. I wanted him to fit in the army, but I wasn't sure if painting
the armour red would be too much for a shaman. I thought any other color would look out of place though, and in the
end I think he looks pretty good and fits in really well with the rest of the army.
