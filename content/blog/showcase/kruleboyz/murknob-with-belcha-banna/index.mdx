## Miniature Review

This is one of my favorite miniatures in the army. As I said before with the Gutrippaz the shields are my favorite part,
and this guys banner is like a beefed up version with a tongue hanging out. Not only that, there are another couple
lower down on it, and he even has another on his chest as armour.

The facial expression on him with his missing eye, and his pose makes him seem really heroic so he stands out easily
against the more stalking nature of the rest of the army.

## Roundup

Having blasted through a squad of 10 recently, I spent a little more time on him getting the orange just right, but it
still only took me a few hours to get him done. He really stands out as I wanted him to, so it'll be good to see how
things look with a few more character finished.
