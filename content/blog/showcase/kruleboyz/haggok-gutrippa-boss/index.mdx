## Miniature Review

The real standout to Haggok is his vulture, as without it I don't think he really stands out that much as a boss. It's
fairly simple but I like the feathers and the detail in the head and neck is good. Other than that Haggok is not much
different the other Gutrippaz, maybe looking a bit smaller because of his pose. He does have a unique shield design
though which is pretty nice.

## Roundup

Being a Commemorative Series miniature I thought there would be some extra details on him I didn't first spot to spend
some extra time on, but other than the vulture he really wasn't that different. He was a simple paint job and I only
had to use a couple of extra colors for the vulture to make it stand out but still fit well with the army.
