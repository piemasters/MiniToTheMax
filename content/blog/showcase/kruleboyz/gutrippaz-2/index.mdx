## Miniature Review

This squad was another eBay lot, but was purchased separately to the others. It was built with a banner bearer, a
couple of musicians, some spears (or Wicked Stikkas) and the rest having Wicked Hackas. There's 12 in the unit so I
guess it makes it possible to swap some options in or out.

They fit in well with the other unit, having even more variation in poses and armour. I hadn't noticed until painting
this unit just how long their arms are, making them a lot more lanky than I previously thought. The shields are still
my favorite part of them, but I do also like the detail of the hand hanging from the drum.

## Painting Techniques

## Roundup

Because of how they were previously painted I think these may have come out a little messier than the previous unit.
They still fit in well with the other unit and the rest of the army though, and I do'nt think it's noticeable when
looking at the army as a whole. It's just been really great to get these large squads painted so quickly, the army
is really coming together!
