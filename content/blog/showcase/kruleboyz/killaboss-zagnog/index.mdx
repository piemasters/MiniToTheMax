## Miniature Review

Zagnog was released as a commemorative series miniature for the new edition of Age of Sigmar. Similarly to Murgruk
they went with another small Kruleboy boss, rather than something bulkier and more powerful. The detail on the miniature
is really sharp, especially around the face and shield, but overall for me it's a bit of a letdown and doesn't really
stand out compared to even the gutrippaz.

## Roundup

This guy was fairly simple, I painted him using the same techniques as the Gutrippaz and the other Killabosses. I
didn't spend too long on him as there wasn't much detail to really separate him out from others in the army.
