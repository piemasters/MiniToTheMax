> Slittabosses command the Hobgrot kompanies that maraud across the realms in search of plunder. They are not only
> the most physically imposing and dark-hearted of their kind but also the canniest. Each is a master swindler and
> murderous in ripping loot from the battlefield, no matter who currently possesses it.

## Miniature Review

The Hobgrot Slittaboss is massive compared to the other Hobgrot Slittaz, he's not far off the size of on the
regular Kruleboyz. The broad pose holding the massive sword, along with the spiked heads create a strong X shape
that draws the eye to the centre of the model.

## Roundup

I followed the same recipe as the other Hobgrot Slittaz, but I did add a few extra details to make him stand out.
These were mostly around the spiked heads, the blood on the sword and the scars. It's not my best paint job but
it was quick at least and matches the rest of the hobgrots.
