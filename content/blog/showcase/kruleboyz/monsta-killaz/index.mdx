## Miniature Review

These cunning fighters are led by a scarred Beastnob, while the Bawla Boy bashes out a threatening beat to terrify
quarry and rivals. Cruel orruk Neckslicers are joined by Gnarlwood Howlaz - tamed simian creatures that help lure larger
fauna out of their dens. The warband is rounded out by the diminutive Klutcha-grot, tasked with raiding monster-nests
and snatching whatever they can get their grotty hands on.

The Beastnob is an amazing miniature, easily my favorite of the non-monster units of all the Kruleboyz. He's massive
compared to the others, with a great wide pose and a lot of height. There so many trinkets like the dinosaur skull and
lion trophy, and even the log base adds to the movement and dexterity of the miniature.

The other miniatures are a lot more plain, but also have some interest. The monkeys are new to the army, but fit in
well with similar pelts and a bit of rope and metal on them. The hobgrot holding the egg adds a bit of humour to the
set, while the rest are fairly generic with a bit more of a tribal vibe.

## Roundup

These were good fun to paint as most Gutrippaz don't have a huge amount of skin on show so it allowed for a lot of
highlighting that I think came out really well. After that the paint job for most of them was fairly quick and easy,
especially the monkeys, leaving just the Beastnob.

I took my time on him and was careful with the use of colors as with all the different textures it would have been
easy to make him look like a rainbow. In the end he fits in nicely with the unit and the rest of the army, but has
a few points of interest like the egg and lion pelt that he stands out nicely, even though the sculpt itself does a
great job of that.
