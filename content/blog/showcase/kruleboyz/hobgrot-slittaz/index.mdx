## Miniature Review

I was looking for more grots to expand my army on eBay and came across a super cheap bundle of Kruleboyz partially
painted and I had to pick them up. At some point I wanted to collect a big destruction army of Orruks, Kruleboyz and
Gloomspite Gitz so this has just pushed things ahead a bit sooner than I'd planned.

I'm starting off by sticking to grots with the Hobgrot Slittaz. They're not my favorite unit of the range but they make
up the bulk of the numbers as the weakest infantry so getting them out the way means lots of big monsters soon to
follow!

They remind me a bit of the Goblin Warriors Games Workshop put out for the Lord of the Rings line, but with more armour
and a different color-scheme. The bombs are a different approach that make them different to other Orruks and they have
a good range of details and stances between them all.

## Painting Techniques

### Skin

<Paint name={'Zandri Dust'} />
<Paint name={'Skeleton Horde'} />
<Paint name={'Lahmian Medium'} />
<Paint name={'Aggaros Dunes'} />
<Paint name={'Hobgrot Hide'} />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Volupus Pink'} />
<Paint name={'Aethermatic Blue'} />

A full Skeleton Horde shade was applied using Lahmian Medium 1:2, followed by a second recess shade of Aggaros Dunes.
It was then highlighted gradually from Hobgrot Hide to Ushabti Bone using mixes of the two paints to transition.
A thin glaze of Volupus Pink was applied to areas like the face, elbows, knees, veins etc, and Aethermatic Blue was
added around the eyes.

### Leather

<Paint name={'Zandri Dust'} />
<Paint name={'Cygor Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Lahmian Medium'} />
<Paint name={'Baneblade Brown'} />

Cygor Brown was thinned using Lahmian Medium 1:1 as a shade.

<Paint name={'Xereus Purple'} />
<Paint name={'Genestealer Purple'} />

### Red Ropes

<Paint name={'Blood Angels Red'} />

A final highlight of Stormhost Silver was then applied.

### Steel

<Paint name={'Iron Hands Steel'} />
<Paint name={'Black Templar'} />
<Paint name={'Gryph Charger Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Stormhost Silver'} />

A shade of Black Templar and Gryph Charger Grey 1:3 was applied, followed by an edge highlight of Iron Hands Steel and
a final highlight of Stormhost Silver.

## Base

The bases covered in a Stirland Mud, then a number of tufts were applied, finished off with a healthy amount of
water effects.

Finally I painted the outside of the base:

## Roundup

I was able to get these painted fairly quickly which was great for so many miniatures. I'm hoping to paint the next
unit of Kruleboyz in a similar way and really power through the army before getting back to my Gloomspite Gitz.
