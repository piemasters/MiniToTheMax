## Miniature Review

This miniature is massive. I wanted to build up the base a bit like I do with everything else, but it already barely
fits into the shelf I store it in so I had to glue it straight to the base. The open wings are great and makes it far
more natural looking than older miniatures, as well as looking much larger than it otherwise would.

Despite mostly being made up of feathers there are a lot of different details and textures on this miniature. The
orruks that can sit on top have a lot on display around them, as well as the various trophies hanging from the Vulcha's
body.

Overall I think it's a great leader for the army, and I like they went with something less bulky or clumsy compared to
the Ironjawz or the Gloomspite Gitz.

## Base

The base was created using corkboard, with Stirland Mud used to fill in any gaps. It was then painted with some greys
and browns for the dirt and rock. Once painted a number of tufts were applied, then after a few easter eggs like a
chest and a frog it was finished off with a healthy amount of water effects. A few layers of Blood For The Blood God
was also applied over the Vulcha's meal.

## Roundup

I was a bit worried painting Gobsprakk as he's the leader of the army and by far the biggest miniature. I'm still fairly
new to airbrushing but I knew I would get a much smoother effect with the blending on the wings using it. I was really
happy with the result, although I could have gone brighter with the red as it was a bit lost after the final drybrush.
Maybe I would have been better drybrushing those areas with red instead.

As well as painting Gobsprakk I also painted up the pieces to use the miniature as a Killaboss On Corpse Rippa Vulcha
instead. I might actually prefer the look of the Killaboss, or at least the Vulcha's head.

I'm also pretty happy with the base, although I need to be more careful in the future to apply thinner layers as I had
some cracking that was difficult to fully fix.
