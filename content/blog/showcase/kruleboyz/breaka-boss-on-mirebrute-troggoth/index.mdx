## Miniature Review

The Mirebrute Troggoth is somewhat similar to the Rockgut Troggoths, but is a lot taller, with much more gangly limbs.
The pose is great, looking set to charge or smash something to pieces, not that I'm sure if the Breakaboss on top
would manage to hold on if he did.

The belt is a great addition to help the monster fit in with the rest of the army. I would have liked to have had a few
options for weapons, as if you added a few to the army they would all look fairly similar with only simple face swaps.

## Painting Techniques

### Troggoth Skin

<Paint name={'Temple Guard Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Lupercal Green'} />
<Paint name={'Ulthuan Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Coelia Greenshade'} />
<Paint name={'Drakenhof Nightshade'} />
<Paint name={'Dorn Yellow'} />

I applied Temple Guard Blue and Lupercal Green with an airbrush, building up more layers where the light would
naturally hit. I then applied Ulthuan Grey with an airbrush on the more fleshy patches of flesh, mostly under the
arms and around the belly. I then gave it a few thinned down layers of Coelia Greenshade and Drakenhof Nightshade,
then finally used Dorn Yellow to pick out the spots.

## Roundup

This is the first time I've used the airbrush to really apply color, previously I've only used it for basecoating and
zenithal highlighting from black to white. It was a bit stressful trying to figure out the best colors to blend
together, and trying to avoid making mistakes. However, it was really quick to do and looked great after some washes.

I need a lot more practice but it was really cool to see how quick I could get such a large part of the miniature done,
and just how smooth it came out compared to my best attempts wet blending with a brush.
