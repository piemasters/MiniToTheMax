## Miniature Review

I was really surprised how big this guy was, both the Killaboss and the Gnashtoof. I thought compared to the other
monsters in the army it would be one of the smallest but it's actually a similar height to the Mirebrute Troggoth and
the Sludgeraker.

The Gnashtoof is an interesting mix of different creates and has a great pose climbing over the ruins. The Killaboss
feels a bit too big when compared to the other Orruks but other than that it suits with the rest of the army well.

## Painting Techniques

## Roundup

I really wasn't sure what colors to use for the Gnashtoof Skin. I watched a number of tutorials and didn't really get
the effect I was looking for. It came out a lot more brown than I had hoped, I was aiming for more of a bruised
purple.

Beyond that the rest was painted as usual, although I did lose the teeth on the shield so had to craft and alternative
using a couple of spare helmets. It's not ideal but makes him look unique and isn't too dissimilar to the original.
