## Miniature Review

I always find with Orc and Goblin armies it's easy to forget to add any range units. They tend to look a bit awkward
with bows and never have the best poses. I like the direction they've taken with the Kruleboyz range units though.
Crossbows are much cooler than regular bows when it comes to orcs, and as they're much more of a stealthy army it
makes sense.

The crossbows themselves are fairly simple, but the wood and other materials link in well with the rest of the armies
weapons. The addition of the large belt armour helps with the lack of shields, so once again blend in well.

## Roundup

It was surprising that I was able to use the same color scheme without any additions from previous units to get
these guys done. They look great with the rest of the army and having a bit of space on their quivers for a bit of
color helps them stand out a little on the table.
