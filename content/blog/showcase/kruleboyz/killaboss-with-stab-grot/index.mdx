## Miniature Review

Once again this was an ebay lot that came partially painted. Unfortunately it came built with the flail rather than the
shield (I really like the shields) but the pose is great with the axe held high and the flail held lower out to the
side. It gives him a wide pose that makes him feel bigger than the other Gutrippaz. The Stab-grot is a nice touch,
having a little mini-me apprentice learning how to fight alongside him.

## Roundup

The Killaboss came painted with a lot more vibrant colors compared to the rest I bought. I wasn't sure how my scheme
would work over the top and whether I would need to strip him back, but in the end I think it worked well and the
slight tone difference works fairly well to help him stand out as a leader around the rest of the army.
