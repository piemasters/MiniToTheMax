## Miniature Review

Although not very tall, the base for the Suffocating Gravetide is pretty huge. At first, it looks like a barrier like
the Prismatic Palisade. Then you realise it's actually a tidal-wave of mud with ghostly skulls leading the way.

The ground and dirt has been done really well, with different wreckage and rocks all mixed in. The skulls blend into it
nicely, but I really wish they faced up a bit. Although they're at a great angle for onlooking miniatures, when on the
table you can't see much of them.

With the base fully brown and will a bit of texture I then added
[Patchy Plains](https://www.geekgamingscenics.com/collections/base-ready-range/products/lukes-aps-base-ready-patchy-plains)
to the base. It's a good mix of different sands and flock that gives the base a great look with minimal effort.

Once dried I then added both [Army Painter Lowland Shrubs](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B086MBW9R9) and
[Army Painter Swamp Tufts](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07R8GZQYR) to break up the flat areas left by the
Patchy Plains.

## Roundup

I really wasn't fully sure how I was going to paint the skulls right until the end, and until I got the right levels of
wash and highlight I really wasn't happy with it. It's not easy blending white, green, blue and brown all together
nicely, but the resulting effect looks like just like ghosts bursting from the ground, so I'm more than happy.

With that the boxset it completed!
