## Miniature Review

I'm not a huge fan of this miniature. I like the idea of a burning skull rampaging across the battlefield, but the fire
trailing behind it is very flat meaning it doesn't look great from a lot of angles, especially the front. It really
needs to be made more 3D, maybe with some smoke to help bulk it out.

I'm also not sure how well the skull blends in with the rest of the fire. There are some sharp edges around the back of
the skull, making it appear to be a separate object to the flames. Because of this I think it's better to paint the
skull as bone rather than fire, which isn't a problem it's just not how it's painted on the box.

## Painting Techniques

### Skull

<Paint name={'Morghast Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Rakarth Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />

### Fire

<Paint name={'Corax White'} />
<Paint name={'Iyanden Yellow'} />
<Paint name={'Nazdreg Yellow'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

### Base

<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Stirland Mud'} />

With the base fully brown and will a bit of texture I then added
[Patchy Plains](https://www.geekgamingscenics.com/collections/base-ready-range/products/lukes-aps-base-ready-patchy-plains)
to the base. It's a good mix of different sands and flock that gives the base a great look with minimal effort.

Once dried I then added both [Army Painter Lowland Shrubs](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B086MBW9R9) and
[Army Painter Swamp Tufts](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07R8GZQYR) to break up the flat areas left by the
Patchy Plains.

## Roundup

I painted the fire the wrong way round, I know. It should be brighter towards the recesses where the heat is, getting
darker towards the tips of the flames where it's cooling down to air temperature. The problem is I had already applied
the contrast paints by the time I realised my mistake, and it looked too good to paint over. Doing it the other way
would have been a lot more time-consuming as well and that's what I'm actively trying to avoid. It's magic flames so
it's fine right?

I'm really happy with how the skull came out painting it like bone. I originally painted the whole thing as flames just
to see how it would look, and it wasn't great. The bone colour draws your eye in to the focal point of the miniature,
and makes it look like it's flying leaving a trail of fire behind it, rather than a ball of fire resembling a skull
burning across the ground.
