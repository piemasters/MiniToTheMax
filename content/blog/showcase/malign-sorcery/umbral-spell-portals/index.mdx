## Miniature Review

Realm-gates are a bif part of Age of Sigmar for me, so having a couple of portals to teleport across the board is a
really cool idea. The portals themselves have a load of detail surrounding them and the ripes are a really great touch,
I would hate to have to try and freehand those on.

## Painting Techniques

### Portals

<Paint name={'Corax White'} />
<Paint name={'Nighthaunt Gloom'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Seer'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

### Gold

<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Liberator Gold'} />
<Paint name={'Stormhost Silver'} />

### Base

<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Stirland Mud'} />

With the base fully brown and will a bit of texture I then added
[Patchy Plains](https://www.geekgamingscenics.com/collections/base-ready-range/products/lukes-aps-base-ready-patchy-plains)
to the base. It's a good mix of different sands and flock that gives the base a great look with minimal effort.

Once dried I then added both [Army Painter Lowland Shrubs](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B086MBW9R9) and
[Army Painter Swamp Tufts](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07R8GZQYR) to break up the flat areas left by the
Patchy Plains.

## Roundup

When painting the portals I thought I might ruin them by messing up with the highlighting and having to start over, but
was lucky and got it right first time on both! I did a bit of OSL on the gold but might add a bit more in the future.

Overall for a couple of core colours they're really effective and one of my favorites of the set!
