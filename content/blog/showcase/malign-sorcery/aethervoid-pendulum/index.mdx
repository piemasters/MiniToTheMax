## Miniature Review

The Aethervoid Pendulum is one of the biggest spells in the box and looks great with the trailing flame behind it. This
thing will look seriously deadly on the battlefield, cutting right through entire regiments.

It doesn't have a huge amount of detail to it, but there are some great runes around the blade itself and the flames
do the most of the work.

### Base

<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />

With the base fully brown and will a bit of texture I then added
[Patchy Plains](https://www.geekgamingscenics.com/collections/base-ready-range/products/lukes-aps-base-ready-patchy-plains)
to the base. It's a good mix of different sands and flock that gives the base a great look with minimal effort.

Once dried I then added both [Army Painter Lowland Shrubs](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B086MBW9R9) and
[Army Painter Swamp Tufts](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07R8GZQYR) to break up the flat areas left by the
Patchy Plains.

## Roundup

I painted the metal a fair bit darker than I normally would to give it a more sinister, grimy feel. Adding the thin
layer of Drakenhof Nightshade to the flames helped to give it a bit more of a magical feel, despite staying fairly dark.

I did make sure to highlight the tips of the flame heavily though to prevent it blending in to the background and
overall I'm really pleased with the effect!
