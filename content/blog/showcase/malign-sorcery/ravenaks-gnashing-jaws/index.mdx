## Miniature Review

After the Purple Sun the Gnashing Jaws are the next large spell, and are truly huge when compared to everything else.
The shape of the jaw is a bit too square for my liking, but I love the teeth and think it's important they're made
the centerpiece of the miniature.

The pattern of the flame is also nicely done, with enough gaps to see the multiple layers without looking too hollow.

## Painting Techniques

### Flames

<Paint name={'Corax White'} />
<Paint name={'Iyanden Yellow'} />
<Paint name={'Nazdreg Yellow'} />
<Paint name={'Hexos Palesun'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

### Teeth

<Paint name={'Morghast Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Rakarth Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Reikland Fleshshade'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />

I gave the teeth a light wash of Reikland Fleshshade over all the teeth, then used Agrax Earthshade just at the roots.

### Base

<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Stirland Mud'} />

With the base fully brown and will a bit of texture I then added
[Patchy Plains](https://www.geekgamingscenics.com/collections/base-ready-range/products/lukes-aps-base-ready-patchy-plains)
to the base. It's a good mix of different sands and flock that gives the base a great look with minimal effort.

Once dried I then added both [Army Painter Lowland Shrubs](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B086MBW9R9) and
[Army Painter Swamp Tufts](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07R8GZQYR) to break up the flat areas left by the
Patchy Plains.

## Roundup

Once again I used the same fire technique. It's just so easy and for how good it looks it's hard to invest so much
time doing it properly. The blend on the teeth is maybe a bit rougher than I would like, but it's easy to smooth them
out another time. For now I really like the contrast they bring to the fire and stand out nicely.
