## Miniature Review

The Prismatic Palisade makes a great looking wall for units to hide behind. I would actually love more things like this
as scenery, rather than just a one off endless spell.

The crystal shards are broken up a bit in places, giving some chance to add additional colour of the light reflecting
through them which is a nice tough. The way the crystals break through the ground is also a nice tough, and blends them
in nicely with the base.

## Painting Techniques

### Crystal

<Paint name={'Corax White'} />
<Paint name={'Iyanden Yellow'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

I watered the Iyanden Yellow down a fair bit and applied it very lightly over a couple of washes.

### Crystal Interiors

<Paint name={'Blood Angels Red'} />
<Paint name={'Akhelian Green'} />
<Paint name={'Warp Lightning'} />
<Paint name={'Gryph Hound Orange'} />
<Paint name={'Shyish Purple'} />

I picked out each of the exposed interiors with a different colour.

### Base

<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Stirland Mud'} />

With the base fully brown and will a bit of texture I then added
[Patchy Plains](https://www.geekgamingscenics.com/collections/base-ready-range/products/lukes-aps-base-ready-patchy-plains)
to the base. It's a good mix of different sands and flock that gives the base a great look with minimal effort.

Once dried I then added both [Army Painter Lowland Shrubs](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B086MBW9R9) and
[Army Painter Swamp Tufts](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07R8GZQYR) to break up the flat areas left by the
Patchy Plains.

## Roundup

Painting the yellow on the shards themselves was really quick and looked great after the final edge highlighting. Adding
a few dots of colour though really brought it to life, adding a lot more visual interest on both sides spotting all the
colours of the rainbow.
