## Miniature Review

The death energy around the vortex is a lot more 3D than the burning head and almost has the shape of a grasping hand.
I'm still not the biggest fan of the miniature though, it's maybe just a bit too plain. I think it needs some
Nighthaunt Tormented Spirits or just some skulls flying around it to give it a more sinister feel.

## Painting Techniques

### Vortex

<Paint name={'Corax White'} />
<Paint name={'Magos Purple'} />
<Paint name={'Shyish Purple'} />
<Paint name={'Lucius Lilac'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

A couple of layers of Magos Purple was applied, followed by a number of thin layers of Shyish Purple, focusing more and
more towards the death energy surrounding the vortex.

### Death Energy

<Paint name={'Corax White'} />
<Paint name={'Hexwraith Flame'} />
<Paint name={'Nighthaunt Gloom'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

### Base

<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Stirland Mud'} />

With the base fully brown and will a bit of texture I then added
[Patchy Plains](https://www.geekgamingscenics.com/collections/base-ready-range/products/lukes-aps-base-ready-patchy-plains)
to the base. It's a good mix of different sands and flock that gives the base a great look with minimal effort.

Once dried I then added both [Army Painter Lowland Shrubs](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B086MBW9R9) and
[Army Painter Swamp Tufts](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07R8GZQYR) to break up the flat areas left by the
Patchy Plains.

## Roundup

I don't often use purple, and it's great to have the contrast in colour between the vortex and the surrounding energy.
It would be possible to paint and attach some surrounding flying spirits in the future to really finish it off, maybe
when I decide to pick up a new army!
