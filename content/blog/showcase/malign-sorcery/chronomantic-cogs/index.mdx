## Miniature Review

The cogs are fairly simple, but I really like the overall shape. The trailing fog really makes the miniature, giving
the cogs movement as well as making them appear to float across the battlefield.

I feel like they could use a bit of danger added to them though, maybe sharper gears or trailing spikes. Right now it
doesn't look like the most dangerous thing on the battlefield, especially when compared to some of the others in the
set.

## Painting Techniques

### Cogs

<Paint name={'Castellax Bronze'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Reikland Fleshshade'} />
<Paint name={'Castellax Bronze'} />
<Paint name={'Sycorax Bronze'} />
<Paint name={'Golden Griffon'} />
<Paint name={'Necron Compound'} />

### Smoke

<Paint name={'Grey Seer'} />
<Paint name={'Nighthaunt Gloom'} />
<Paint name={'Grey Seer'} />
<Paint name={'White Scar'} />

The Nighthaunt Gloom was heavily watered down before applying, as I only wanted the colour to show in the recesses.

### Base

<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Stirland Mud'} />

With the base fully brown and will a bit of texture I then added
[Patchy Plains](https://www.geekgamingscenics.com/collections/base-ready-range/products/lukes-aps-base-ready-patchy-plains)
to the base. It's a good mix of different sands and flock that gives the base a great look with minimal effort.

Once dried I then added both [Army Painter Lowland Shrubs](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B086MBW9R9) and
[Army Painter Swamp Tufts](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07R8GZQYR) to break up the flat areas left by the
Patchy Plains.

## Roundup

Once again it's great to see you can achieve a decent effect with only a few colours. I do wonder if I made the trailing
smoke darker, more like a heavy soot with some trailing embers, if it would look more dangerous. My only worry would be
that it could look less magical and the floating effect wouldn't look quite right. When in doubt copy the 'Eavy Metal
team!
