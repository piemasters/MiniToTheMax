## Miniature Review

The Geminids are almost like small versions of the Purple Sun. The orbs themselves have a similar texture on them, but
what makes them is the crackling lightning around them. The weaving of the lighting suspending them is really great as
each bolt wraps around the other.

## Painting Techniques

### Base

<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Stirland Mud'} />

With the base fully brown and will a bit of texture I then added
[Patchy Plains](https://www.geekgamingscenics.com/collections/base-ready-range/products/lukes-aps-base-ready-patchy-plains)
to the base. It's a good mix of different sands and flock that gives the base a great look with minimal effort.

Once dried I then added both [Army Painter Lowland Shrubs](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B086MBW9R9) and
[Army Painter Swamp Tufts](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07R8GZQYR) to break up the flat areas left by the
Patchy Plains.

## Roundup

These are fairly simple models so only needed a few colours to paint them. I do wonder if it would have looked better to
paint the white orb with black lightning to create a better yin and yang effect, but I wouldn't want it to be too dark.
The contrast paints left a nice effect that they didn't really need drybrushing which is great, just a final Corax White
highlight on the lightning.
