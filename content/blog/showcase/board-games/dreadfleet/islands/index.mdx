import Paint from "../../../../../components/paint";

Having worked on a few Space Wolves, I started to feel bad at the number of old board games I still have looking at me
unpainted. I decided that before expanding the army too much, as it will likely never stop, I should paint at least one
more now. Dreadfleet was one of the older ones and is something truly unique that I don't expect anything similar to
come out any time soon.

> Captain Jaego Roth of the Heldenhammer has vowed to hunt down and destroy Count Noctilus and his

To start things off easy I decided to leave the boats for last and start with some bigger pieces, so it might look like
I'd painted more than I had. The islands seemed like the biggest, so the best place to start!

## Miniature Review

I was quite surprised by the detail on the islands. The rocks themselves are fairly simple, but I expected all the
different details on them. There're the castles, monuments, shipwrecks, giant skeletons and even lava. As a set they
make for some interesting scenery to play around, something I hadn't really remembered from looking through the rulebook
previously.

## Painting Techniques

### Ocean
<Paint name={'Kantor Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Caledor Sky'} />
<Paint name={'Teclis Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Ahriman Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Biel Tan Green'} />
<Paint name={'Drakenhof Nightshade'} />
<Paint name={'Ahriman Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Lothern Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Blue Horror'} />
<Paint name={'Etherium Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

As the colours become brighter, they should be focused closer and closer around the waves.

### Rock
<Paint name={'Abaddon Black'} />
<Paint name={'Eshin Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Skavenblight Dinge'} />
<Paint name={'Nuln Oil'} />
<Paint name={'Dawnstone'} />
<Paint name={'Administratum Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Warpstone Glow'} />
<Paint name={'Biel Tan Green'} />

The Nuln Oil shade was applied heavier towards the bottom of the rocks. Once highlighted, the seaweed was drybrushed on
roughly with Warpstone Glow then blended in  with Biel Tan Green.

### Stone
<Paint name={'Morghast Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Rakarth Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Seraphim Sepia'} />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />

<Paint name={'Corax White'} />
<Paint name={'Hexwraith Flame'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

### Bones
<Paint name={'Morghast Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Rakarth Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />

### Castle Walls
<Paint name={'Abaddon Black'} />

<Paint name={'Mephiston Red'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Carroburg Crimson'} />

<Paint name={'Evil Sunz Scarlet'} />

## Roundup

With all the pieces painted the rock definitely pulls them all together and gives them a unified look, while the
details give them a bit of brightness and interest.

The lava was time-consuming, starting with white and slowly painting further and further out with each colour so the
heat to show the lava cooling off as it hits the sea air. It looks great though now it's done, along with the skull eyes
adding some real brightness to the otherwise fairly drab islands.
