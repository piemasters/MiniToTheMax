## Miniature Review

Grimnir's Thunder is an impregnable floating fortress and aircraft carrier, built from heavy plated silversteel.
There's a lot of dwarven engineering gone into the steam-driven paddles in their armoured shells to self-loading,
swivel-mounted Flame Cannons and industrial-sized engines.

The dirigibles grant unparalleled scouting capability, required due to the slow speed of the battleship to ensure
maximum destruction can be achieved, regardless of wind or tide to sate their Dwarf-held grudge.

The design of the Grimnir's Thunder is fairly simple, but very ornate and a couple of points of interest with the
dirigibles and beer barrel. There are also plenty of cannons visible, as well as some dwarven iconography.

## Roundup

Grimnir's Thunder was fairly simple to paint in terms of colours as it uses a limited palette, but the colours are
spread out nicely, so it's not boring to look at. I also used the shades on the armour in a bit more of a patchy manor
to help break up the flat panels.

The green really felt like it brought the whole thing to life, adding some brightness and colour to the miniature with
the mottled effect helping it tie in with the ornate effect.

The dirigibles were painted with the same colours, as well as a dirty white for the fabric of the balloon to add a bit
more brightness to the pair.
