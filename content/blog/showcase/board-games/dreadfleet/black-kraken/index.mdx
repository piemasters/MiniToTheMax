## Miniature Review

So I'm onto the next ship, and again I'm really avoiding painting the ships by this time focusing on the submarine of
the fleet, the Back Kraken piloted by a Chaos Dwarf Engineer.

Powered by warpstone and believed to have a mind of its own, this monster has both an array of cannons and Torpedoes
for ranged combat as well as a number of tentacles for getting up close and personal. It also seems to have a large
harpoon or drill for cracking the hardest of hulls.

The tentacles are great, and the dripping water gives them a great sense of movement. The gears and pistons make you
look over the miniature to try to figure out what they're all doing and how the machine works which is always fun.

## Roundup

Although the tentacles are great, I felt the miniature really came alive once adding the warpstone glow effects to it.
It's a dark model, so the green really makes it stand out. The torpedoes are quick to spot being the only red used, but
they help to draw your eye to the finer details like the dwarf symbol and all the rivets.

I went similarly dark with the cog and painted the symbol on the sail the same way as the warpstone to tie the two
together nicely. I think a small robotic squid would have matched with the Kraken better though!
