## Miniature Review

Ok so finally onto some real ships, although this one still doesn't have a sail. Baby steps!

Instead of sails are statues of Nehekharan gods which stand ready to protect the ship and its many catapults that line
the deck. The most lethal weapon however is the Jewel of the River Mortis, that on command can release captured
sunlight onto the pyramid below creating a column of light that can swathe even the mightiest of enemy vessels in flame.

It's really great to see a such a unique idea for a ship in miniature form, which not only has such elaborate detail
but also really follows the ancient Egyptian theme of the old Tomb Kings. I think this is easily one of my favorite
ships in the fleet.

## Roundup

I always really enjoy using turquoise paints. Unless painting a Tzeentch army I find it is rarely used elsewhere other
than maybe an odd potion or gem. The yellow and gold really complement it, and the single green jewel makes the
dangerous weapon of the ship clearly visible.

Once again I painted the cog using the same colour palette. I went to add a single Egyptian eye to the sail but got my
scale wrong. I was really happy with it and didn't want to start over again, so I ended up adding another two on. I'm
not fully happy with it and would have preferred a single eye but it'll do for now. I also wanted to represent the jewel
somehow so added it to the top flag, but I think there might have been a better way to represent it.
