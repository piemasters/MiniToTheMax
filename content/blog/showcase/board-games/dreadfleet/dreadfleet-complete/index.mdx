Well it's been journey, but the Dreadfleet boxset is finally complete after having it stored away for 10 years.
I'm super happy with how each ship has turned out, and it all looks great together on the seascape gaming mat.

Hopefully in the future I'll be able to play a few games and write up a review, maybe even some battle reports.
For now, I'll keep it short and leave you with some photos of everything and links to how I painted everything.
