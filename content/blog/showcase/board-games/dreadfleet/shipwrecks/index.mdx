## Miniature Review

The natural follow on from painting the islands seemed to be the islands. The rocks look the same as expected, as do
most of the shipwrecks.

The only different piece is the dwarven shipwreck. It's a pretty small piece with a few runes, and some barnacles to
add some extra detail. The waves lapping over it are also a bit different to the other islands, which look good, but I'm
not sure if it makes it look too different to the rest of the terrain.

## Roundup

This was a pretty quick one as it's largely more of the same, but it was too much to paint all the islands and
shipwrecks together. I really like the ghostly technical paints as it makes painting the shipwrecks much quicker than
it would using a more traditional blending method.

I only added a small amount of weathering to the dwarven shipwreck for now, as I want it to be easy to spot when
playing games. I might add a bit more and darken it down a bit once I've got everything done to make it look like it
sunk a long time ago and maybe make it look a bit more sinister.
