## Miniature Review

To continue on with avoiding the boats I painted all the playing pieces. The Wind Gauge token has a lot of great detail
on it, and is completely different on both sides. The Ship's Wheels are only one sided but again look really nice, with
the text and skeleton captain adding a lot of character. The Navigation Rod is also really 3D and completely different
to any other ruler you'd get with anything else.

These are easily the best components I've seen for playing a board game, both for the detail and for having a lot of
colour, even if you have to add it yourself. They really need a good varnish cover though otherwise they'll likely
have paint rubbed off in areas over time.

## Painting Techniques

### Ocean
<Paint name={'Kantor Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Caledor Sky'} />
<Paint name={'Teclis Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Ahriman Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Biel Tan Green'} />
<Paint name={'Drakenhof Nightshade'} />
<Paint name={'Ahriman Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Lothern Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Etherium Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

As the colours become brighter, they should be focused closer and closer around the waves.

### Bronze
<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Castellax Bronze'} />
<Paint name={'Sycorax Bronze'} />

### Steel
<Paint name={'Leadbelcher'} />
<Paint name={'Nuln Oil'} />
<Paint name={'Leadbelcher'} />
<Paint name={'Runefang Steel'} />
<Paint name={'Necron Compound'} />

### Checkerboard
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />
<Paint name={'Abaddon Black'} />
<Paint name={'Nuln Oil'} />
<Paint name={'Eshin Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

Once painting alternate checks black and white, apply a very thin shade of Nuln Oil, then highlight back up, so the
shade is only seen around the recesses.

### Bone
<Paint name={'Morghast Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Rakarth Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Seraphim Sepia'} />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />

### Emeralds
<Paint name={'Warpstone Glow'} />
<Paint name={'Moot Green'} />
<Paint name={'Gauss Blaster Green'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

### Rubies
<Paint name={'Khorne Red'} />
<Paint name={'Mephiston Red'} />
<Paint name={'Evil Sunz Scarlet'} />
<Paint name={'Wild Rider Red'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

### Smoke
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />
<Paint name={'Nuln Oil'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

## Roundup

The pieces looked great before painting them and now they look fantastic. Even the little trophies I had forgotten
about until the end look good and something you want to look at and prize once you've collected it. In most games the
miniatures are the main focus with everything else hidden to the side, but with this game it feels like everything is
worthy of being included in the final photos!
