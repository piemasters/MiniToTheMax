## Miniature Review

Most of the boats come with its own auxiliary. In most cases it's a small ship, but as I want to paint them together
with the main ships I won't cover them here. That leave two miniatures, the Grimnir's Thunder's Dirigible and the
Seadrake's Dragon.

Both are fairly simple miniatures but add a bit of variety so there's something other than ships to move around. They
fit nicely with their corresponding parent ships and make me wish maybe there had been a few more of them to mix things
up a bit more.

## Painting Techniques

### Ocean
<Paint name={'Kantor Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Caledor Sky'} />
<Paint name={'Teclis Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Ahriman Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Biel Tan Green'} />
<Paint name={'Drakenhof Nightshade'} />
<Paint name={'Ahriman Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Lothern Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Etherium Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

As the colours become brighter, they should be focused closer and closer around the waves.

## Roundup

These were pretty quick to paint and as you can see in one of the photos below I may have painted them at the same time
as some other miniatures that I'll be posting about next!
