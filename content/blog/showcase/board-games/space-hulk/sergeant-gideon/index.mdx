> Sergeant Gideon is considered to be something of a maverick individual, happy to flaunt doctrine and tradition if the
> need arises. This is no more evident than his choice of weaponry. Gideon was once a member of a Terminator Assault
> Squad, but upon being promoted to Sergeant replaced his thunder hammer and storm shield with the customary storm
> bolter and power sword. In the next battle, his armour seized up after being hit by a round from an Ork gun and Gideon
> declared that its machine spirit had been offended by the change of armament. Ever since, he has refused to relinquish
> his beloved thunder hammer and storm shield again.

## Painting Techniques

### Armour

<Paint name={'Evil Sunz Scarlet'} />
<Paint name={'Macragge Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Wild Rider Red'} />
<Paint name={'Wild Rider Red'} />
<Paint name={'Phalanx Yellow'} />
<Paint name={'White Scar'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Rhinox Hide'} />
<Paint name={'Leadbelcher'} />
<Paint name={'Wild Rider Red'} />

With an airbrush I started with a zenithal of black to white, followed by a full covering of Evil Sunz Scarlet. I then
added the shadows with Macragge Blue from below, followed by a highlight of Wild Rider Red from the top. The last step
with the airbrush was to mix Wild Rider Red with a bit of Phalanx Yellow and White Scar to create a brighter orangy red
as the final highlight.

With airbrushing finished, I then added a thinned wash of Agrax Earthshade over everything. I followed this by sponging
some Rhinox Hide and Leadbelcher in areas for weathering, then applied a final edge highlight of Wild Rider Red.

## Basing

I bought a few sets of Zone Mortalis Scenic Bases and very closely followed the guide I found
[here](https://www.realmofplastic.com/warhammer/painting-tutorial-zone-mortalis-bases)

<Paint name={'Abaddon Black'} />
<Paint name={'Castellax Bronze'} />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />

I used an airbrush to basecoat them black, followed by a fullcoat of bronze, then a few patches of brown.

<Paint name={'Wild Rider Red'} />
<Paint name={'Fire Dragon Bright'} />
<Paint name={'Zandri Dust'} />

I then stippled patches of red over the brown, then orange over that, then a small amount of Zandri Dust over that.

<Paint name={'Averland Sunset'} />
<Paint name={'Yriel Yellow'} />
<Paint name={'Black Legion'} />

For the hazard stripes I used the darker yellow as the basecoat, then a couple of layers of the brighter yellow before
adding the black stripes.

<Paint name={'Ironbreaker'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />

Everything was given a silver drybrush, followed by a heavy wash to weather everything back down. I then applied some
patches of Dirty Down Rust.

<Paint name={'White Scar'} />
<Paint name={'Frostheart'} />

For the glow coming from the vents I painted white roughly into the recesses then added a layer of Frostheart over the
top, with the idea of any overspill looking like OSL.

<Paint name={'Black Legion'} />

I then applied some Forge World Dark Sand Weathering Powder around the feet to help tie the miniature to the base, then
applied a couple of layers of black to the rim finish it off.
