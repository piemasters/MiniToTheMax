> The Broodlord is always the first Genestealer to make planetfall when the Tyranids first infest a world, and lead the
> Genestealers in their bloody ambushes. They are even more powerful than the standard Genestealer, and are specifically
> adept at infiltration to get closer to the enemy. They are very adaptable and highly intelligent as well as being a
> synapse creature that allows them to function independently from the Hive Mind. Their powerful talons can cut through
> most materials with ease. When a Tyranid hive fleet enters an infested system, the Hive Mind asserts its synaptic
> dominion over the Broodlord and its clan.

## Painting Techniques

### Skin

<Paint name={'Volupus Pink'} />
<Paint name={'Terminatus Stone'} />
<Paint name={'Wrack White'} />
<Paint name={'Praxeti White'} />

### Carapace

<Paint name={'Phoenician Purple'} />
<Paint name={'Shyish Purple'} />
<Paint name={'Genestealer Purple'} />
<Paint name={'Genestealer Purple'} />
<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />

Genestealer Purple & Screaming Skull was mixed 1:1 for the final highlight.

### Claws

<Paint name={'Flesh Tearers Red'} />
<Paint name={'Evil Sunz Scarlet'} />
<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />

Evil Sunz Scarlet & Screaming Skull 1:1 was mixed 1:1 for the final highlight.

### Eyes

<Paint name={'Iyanden Yellow'} />
<Paint name={'Flash Gitz Yellow'} />

### Tongue

<Paint name={'Magos Purple'} />
<Paint name={'Changeling Pink'} />

### Base

I bought a few sets of Zone Mortalis Scenic Bases and very closely followed the guide I found
[here](https://www.realmofplastic.com/warhammer/painting-tutorial-zone-mortalis-bases)

<Paint name={'Abaddon Black'} />
<Paint name={'Castellax Bronze'} />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />

I used an airbrush to basecoat them black, followed by a fullcoat of bronze, then a few patches of brown.

<Paint name={'Wild Rider Red'} />
<Paint name={'Fire Dragon Bright'} />
<Paint name={'Zandri Dust'} />

I then stippled patches of red over the brown, then orange over that, then a small amount of Zandri Dust over that.

<Paint name={'Averland Sunset'} />
<Paint name={'Yriel Yellow'} />
<Paint name={'Black Legion'} />

For the hazard stripes I used the darker yellow as the basecoat, then a couple of layers of the brighter yellow before
adding the black stripes.

<Paint name={'Ironbreaker'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />

Everything was given a silver drybrush, followed by a heavy wash to weather everything back down. I then applied some
patches of Dirty Down Rust.

<Paint name={'White Scar'} />
<Paint name={'Frostheart'} />

For the glow coming from the vents I painted white roughly into the recesses then added a layer of Frostheart over the
top, with the idea of any overspill looking like OSL.

<Paint name={'Black Legion'} />

I then applied some Forge World Dark Sand Weathering Powder around the feet to help tie the miniature to the base, then
applied a couple of layers of black to the rim finish it off.
