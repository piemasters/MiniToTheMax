## Miniature Review

The Blood Angel Terminators in the Space Hulk box still look amazing today around 15 years after their release. Not
only are the heroes well designed, but so are the objectives. The dead Blood Angel sat on the throne is still a stand
out piece today and something I don't really remember seeing replicated since.

## Painting Techniques

### Armour

<Paint name={'Mephiston Red'} type="air" />
<Paint name={'Macragge Blue'} type="air" />
<Paint name={'Evil Sunz Scarlet'} t ype="air" />
<Paint name={'Phalanx Yellow'} type="air" />
<Paint name={'White Scar'} type="air" />

With an airbrush I started with a zenithal of black to white, followed by a full covering of Evil Sunz Scarlet.

I then added the shadows with Macragge Blue from below, followed by a highlight of Evil Sunz Scarlet from the top.

The final airbrush step was to mix Evil Sunz Scarlet with a small amount of Phalanx Yellow and White Scar to create a
brighter orange-red as the final highlight.

<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Evil Sunz Scarlet'} />
<Paint name={'Wild Rider Red'} />
<Paint name={'Troll Slayer Orange'} />
<Paint name={'Tau Light Ochre'} />
<Paint name={'Berserker Bloodshade'} />
<Paint name={'Troll Slayer Orange'} />
<Paint name={'Tau Light Ochre'} />

Next I applied a thinned wash of Agrax Earthshade to the recesses.

To begin edge highlighting I started with Wild Rider Red, followed by Troll Slayer Orange. Next came a 2:1 mix of
Troll Slayer Orange and Tau Light Ochre.

To help blend the highlight I applied a thin glaze of Berserker Bloodshade over the armour then finished by applying
the same final highlight to the brightest areas.

<Paint name={'Rhinox Hide'} />
<Paint name={'Leadbelcher'} />

To finish off with some battle damage I sponged on some Rhinox Hide, then picked out inside the larger brown areas
with Leadbelcher.

## Basing

I bought a few sets of Zone Mortalis Scenic Bases and very closely followed the guide I found
[here](https://www.realmofplastic.com/warhammer/painting-tutorial-zone-mortalis-bases)

<Paint name={'Abaddon Black'} />
<Paint name={'Castellax Bronze'} />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />

I used an airbrush to basecoat them black, followed by a fullcoat of bronze, then a few patches of brown.

<Paint name={'Wild Rider Red'} />
<Paint name={'Fire Dragon Bright'} />
<Paint name={'Zandri Dust'} />

I then stippled patches of red over the brown, then orange over that, then a small amount of Zandri Dust over that.

<Paint name={'Averland Sunset'} />
<Paint name={'Yriel Yellow'} />
<Paint name={'Black Legion'} />

For the hazard stripes I used the darker yellow as the basecoat, then a couple of layers of the brighter yellow before
adding the black stripes.

<Paint name={'Ironbreaker'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />

Everything was given a silver drybrush, followed by a heavy wash to weather everything back down. I then applied some
patches of Dirty Down Rust.

<Paint name={'White Scar'} />
<Paint name={'Frostheart'} />

For the glow coming from the vents I painted white roughly into the recesses then added a layer of Frostheart over the
top, with the idea of any overspill looking like OSL.

<Paint name={'Black Legion'} />

I then applied some Forge World Dark Sand Weathering Powder around the feet to help tie the miniature to the base, then
applied a couple of layers of black to the rim finish it off.

## Roundup

Overall I'm super happy with the result. I wanted to highlight the marine up nice and bright while still keeping him
looking red rather than becoming too orange. I'm happy with the result and think I can use this technique for the
other marines in the box.

The CAT fits in pretty nicely too, although maybe needs the red armour to be highlighted more to match.
