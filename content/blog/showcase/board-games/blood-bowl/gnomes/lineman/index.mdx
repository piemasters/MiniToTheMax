> Though, to the uneducated, a Gnome may look the same as a Halfling, the fact is that they are quite different. Gnomes
> are not bothered about gorging themselves on pies and are instead mainly concerned with the likes of trickery,
> thievery, and making sure that any uninvited 'guests' who stumble upon their hidden burrows are given a swift tackle
> to the knee-caps - the latter of which lends itself nicely to a good old game of Blood Bowl!

## Miniature Review

The linemen are the core players of any Blood Bowl team. These Gnomes are fairly plain, but do include two catchers and
two kickers along with 4 regular linemen. The faces have a huge amount of character, but beyond that there's not a huge
amount else going on. Overall they're ok and help bulk out the team, but I wouldn't say they're the most exciting models
in the range.

## Roundup

The linemen came out nice and colorful, which is what I was aiming for. I didn't go over the top with the details, but
I did try to ad a bit of texture to the coats. I did struggle to get the skin tones bright and warm without becoming
too washed out and pale. Adding red glazes really helped to bring color back when I went too far with the highlights.
