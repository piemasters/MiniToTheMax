> Rodney Roachbait first made a name for himself as a champion angler down the ponds just south of Altdorf; not that
> the big-folk ever realised that there were fishing competitions going on, they just assumed that the small bearded
> folk with pointy hats standing around the water with tiny fishing rods were quaint little statuettes! However, in
> more recent years, Rodney has traded the tackle box for simply tackling others as he's begun a career on the gridiron.

## Miniature Review

Rodney is a great miniatures with so many details that you don't initially spot. The fishing rod is a nice idea as
it adds a lot of height to the miniature, as well as giving him a unique style and an opportunity for a unique rule.

Some of the extra details that stand out are the fish on his hat, the spilt beer and the bucket of worms all escaping.
They tie the miniature together really well and add a lot of character.

## Roundup

Although Rodney uses all the same colors as the rest of the time he still stands out nicely thanks to the odd spots of
additional color like the fish and the rod. I still prefer the Beastmasters as they have the animals, but Rodney is a
great addition to the team and a fun model to paint.
