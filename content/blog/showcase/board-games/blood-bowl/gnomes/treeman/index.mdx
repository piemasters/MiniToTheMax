> Treemen are most commonly thought of as part of the Wood Elf or Halfling teams, though in reality any forest across
> the known world will likely have their own branch of Treemen. This is certainly true of the forests where Gnomes dwell,
> where there are great communities of Treemen that lve alongside the Gnomes and various other creatures. With Gnomes
> having a deep-rooted love of the woods and the critters that live there, the Treemen see it as their solemn duty to
> protect their Gnomish neighbors - especially when they go on their travels to play Blood Bowl.

## Miniature Review

While the Gnomes are all pretty tiny, the Treeman adds a lot of bulk to the team. To give my Gnomes a chance in games
I bought two. The kit gives you a few different options for faces and locations for various branches and extra
details to go. The arms are also fairly posable, so it was easy to make the two look different enough from each
other which is great. The Treeman is a really nice model and a great centerpiece for the team.

## Roundup

I'm really happy with the different schemes for the bark and the leaves between the two Treemen to differentiate them
further. I also flipped the armour panels between blue and red and further difference. There are enough extra details
on them to bring in some of the additional colors used in the rest of the team, which helps tie everything together.
