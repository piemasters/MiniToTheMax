> Of all the creatures that dwell within the forests, Gnomes have the greatest affinity with foxes; almost certainly

> Gnomes will go to great lengths to train these intelligent creatures, teaching them how steal purses from unsuspecting

> Halfling taverns or bakeries and pinch the most prized pies!

## Miniature Review

I bought the Glimdwarrow Groundhogs team as a fun addition to my Blood Bowl collection as I loved all the critters
and the bright colors used. The Woodland Foxes are great with comical faces, especially the one that's managed
to fit almost the entire ball in its mouth!

## Roundup

After applying the first orange contrast paint it was looking really good. However, I really wanted to create a natural
fur effect so wanted to add a lot of subtle highlights using short brush strokes to simulate the hairs catching the
light. I may have achieved a similar effect with a drybrush, but I wanted to try something different.

I also wanted to try a different approach to the eyes, so I painted them brown and then added a yellow highlight, which
I think worked out well. The eyes are one of my favorite parts of the model, they really bring them to life.
