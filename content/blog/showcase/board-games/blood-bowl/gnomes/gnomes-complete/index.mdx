With the whole team now painted, I can finally show off the Glimdwarrow Groundhogs in all their glory! The team looks
great, super vibrant and colourful, with a lot of character.

The woodland creatures really make the team, giving the team some interest over just some differently dressed gnomes.
The Treeman also help to break things up, towering over the rest of the team and adding a real sense of scale.

The bases really help tie the team in with the board, giving them and enchanted forest feel. They help to keep them
looking extra vibrant as well, maybe in the future I'll add some flowers and maybe paint some lines on the bases to
make them look more like a pitch.
