## Miniature Review

I don't expect the Glimdwarrow Groundhogs to be a competitive team, but I love the models and it's something starkly
different to anything Games Workshop makes now, with everything being much more grim dark. The tokens are a great
addition to the team, and although I'd have loved it if they were more critter focused the little gnome balls
and the hedgehogs with the flowers are still great.

## Roundup

These tokens came out great, the colors are nice and vibrant and work well together. There was a lot more detail in
them than I expected and they took quite a long time to finish but they'll look great for games.
