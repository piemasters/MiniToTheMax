> In fact, many pundits have noticed that, if it wasn't for Rowana's timely interventions, the Groundhogs wouldn't have

## Miniature Review

As with Rodney Roachbait, Rowana Forestfoot adds some much needed height to the team. This time however it's a stag
rather than a fishing rod. Although the stag is really nice with a good pose, the pigeons are the real stars of the
show. One has a players cap, another has the referee's cards and the last is wearing the team scarf and is perched
on Rowana's hand.

Rowana is fairly small and simple compared to everything else going on, but her hair and acorn hat do stand out when
looking from the back of the miniature.

## Roundup

Rowana Forestfoot came out all ok and the pigeons are very much still my favorite parts of the miniature. The stag is
a nice addition and although I kept the color scheme fairly simple it came out nicely. The antlers help to add some
brightness to the piece and the browns help tie it in with the Treemen and brings the whole team together.
