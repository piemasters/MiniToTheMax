## Miniature Review

Janus Draik has to be my favorite miniature of the box. I'm not sure if there's ever been a Rogue Trader miniature
before, but he's bang on what I expected. He has the silhouette of an Inquisitor, but is dressed far more flamboyantly
with much lighter armour.

The massive shirt collar and jacket cuffs really help highlight his wealth and the gigantic pelt on his back is
obviously there to invoke fear during negotiations. I would have liked to see a few more interesting trinkets hanging
from his belt over the dagger and gun, but those items do help with his regal tone.

## Roundup

I followed a tutorial from Games Workshop for painting Janus. There's a few areas like the cloak, shirt and trousers I
likely would have used contrast paints to save time otherwise, but it was an interesting process. I always feel like
I learn more when following tutorials online, like thinning down the black to make the stripes. Adding some purple to
the pelts face was also a nice touch.
