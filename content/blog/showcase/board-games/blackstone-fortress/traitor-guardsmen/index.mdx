## Miniature Review

This is a 14 strong unit of Traitor Guardsmen, with 7 unique sculpts. First looking at them, I thought they were pretty
similar to the guardsmen in the Assassinorum boxset. But looking closer there is actually quite a lot more detail on
them.

Along with their regular armour they also have firmer armour plates, furs and metal spikes. They also have a range of
ranged weaponry, surprisingly largely made of wood. Even the flamer is mostly wooden! Their load-out also includes a
number of grenades, swords, clubs and even a shovel.

Personally I'd like them to be a bit more uniform, rather than a bit rough and ready, but the sculpts are decent,
especially for the bulk unit of the box.
