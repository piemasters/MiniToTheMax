> Traitor Guard is a term given to the vast majority of disloyal mortals who have left the Imperial Guard and

## Miniature Review

This is a 14 strong unit of Traitor Guardsmen, with 7 unique sculpts. First looking at them, I thought they were pretty
similar to the guardsmen in the Assassinorum boxset. But looking closer there is actually quite a lot more detail on
them.

Along with their regular armour they also have firmer armour plates, furs and metal spikes. They also have a range of
ranged weaponry, surprisingly largely made of wood. Even the flamer is mostly wooden! Their load-out also includes a
number of grenades, swords, clubs and even a shovel.

Personally I'd like them to be a bit more uniform, rather than a bit rough and ready, but the sculpts are decent,
especially for the bulk unit of the box.

I mixed sand with glue and applied it to the base. I then drybrushed it with Eshin Grey, then Mechanicus Standard Grey.
I then painted the outer base with Rhinox Hide.

## Roundup

I'm glad I stuck to a fairly limited colour palette as painting 14 miniatures takes forever! The wooden weapons came out
great, it's not something I've had to do for a long time. It was the first time I've properly used Dirty Down Rust too,
while it's difficult to control exactly how it looks, the overall effect for the amount of effort is great.

I've painted them to fit in with the chaos guardsmen from the Execution Force boxset and will paint the remaining units
with a similar colour scheme to keep everything tied together or a potential future army.
