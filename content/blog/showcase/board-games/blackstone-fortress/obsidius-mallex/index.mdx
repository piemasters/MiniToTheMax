## Miniature Review

As the big baddie of the box, Mallex is a fairly imposing Chaos Lord. He's not the biggest miniature, the Assassinorum
Sorcerer in Terminator armour is much larger, but has a great confident stance and grizzled face.

Somewhat unexpectedly he's covered in tentacles. The game art doesn't make it obvious as the tentacles are painted the
same as the armour, I assume the armour has become more 'organic' over time. I plan to make them a bit more obvious, as
it makes him really stand out from the other marines. That, and his really cool stone thunder hammer!

## Roundup

As I said before I hadn't really noticed the tentacles from looking at the box art, being black on black. I decided to
paint them pink thinking they would really stand out, but forgot I was changing his armour from black to red. The pink
on red started off a bit too subtle, so I really had to highlight them up more than I had intended.

Having similar colours for the tentacles might actually be the best choice, as if they contrasted too much I think it
could be hard to focus on any point of the miniature. For example, I could have gone with my green spot colour, but that
would have overwhelmed him.

The face, weapon and cloak could really use some improvement. At this point I really just want to get the chaos units
painted, so I can focus more time on the characters. For now the quality looks fine against the rest of the units.
