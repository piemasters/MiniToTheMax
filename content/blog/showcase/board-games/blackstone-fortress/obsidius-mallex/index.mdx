> Mallex has commanded the Servants of the Abyss on several campaigns, most notably fighting under Abaddon in naval
> battles over Cadia in the 13th Black Crusade. As Cadia was destroyed by a Blackstone Fortress, Mallex watched aboard
> his Hades Class Heavy Cruiser Impaler. The explosion threw him into the Warp, where it emerged deep in Segmentum
> Pacificus inside a new Blackstone Fortress.
>
> Impaler melded with the Fortress, stranding Mallex and his warband. Since then Mallex has raged in the darkness,
> taking out his fury at those he manages to take captive. At the same time Mallex hopes to one day master the
> technologies of the Fortress in order to wield the immense power it commands

## Miniature Review

As the big baddie of the box, Mallex is a fairly imposing Chaos Lord. He's not the biggest miniature, the Assassinorum
Sorcerer in Terminator armour is much larger, but has a great confident stance and grizzled face.

Somewhat unexpectedly he's covered in tentacles. The game art doesn't make it obvious as the tentacles are painted the
same as the armour, I assume the armour has become more 'organic' over time. I plan to make them a bit more obvious, as
it makes him really stand out from the other marines. That, and his really cool stone thunder hammer!
