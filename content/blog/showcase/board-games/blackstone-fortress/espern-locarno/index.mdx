## Miniature Review

As with Janus, Espern Locarno is the first Imperial Navigator miniature I think I've seen. The miniature itself first
appears very simple, but has a truly unique, ornate helmet. When paired with the long purple robes it gives him a regal
appearance.

I don't see any kind of weapon, so I assume the third navigator warp eye is all that's needed. With it he can manipulate
the Immaterium to help conceal himself, as well as channel the corrupting power of the Warp onto his enemies. It will
be important to emphasise the eye when painting him to ensure it's the focal point of the miniature.

### Base

I mixed sand with glue and applied it to the base. I then drybrushed it with Eshin Grey, then Mechanicus Standard Grey.
I then painted the outer base with Rhinox Hide.

## Roundup

I really like the deep purple of the robes. I really need to add some purple cloaks or something to a future army!

I also need to practice my freehand text at some point. Currently I can paint thin lines which is fine, but it's the
main thing I've struggled with when trying to replicate other paint jobs.
