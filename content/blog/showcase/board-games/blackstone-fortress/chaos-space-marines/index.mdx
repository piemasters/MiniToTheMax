## Miniature Review

There are only two Space Marines in the box. The sculpts I believe are unique to the box, and look a lot nicer than
the marines in the Assassinorum boxset. They fit in nicely with the Guardsmen and the Rogue Psykers. I wouldn't say
they're anything special, but have enough detail on them, so they stand out from the rest of the army.
