## Miniature Review

There are only two Space Marines in the box. The sculpts I believe are unique to the box, and look a lot nicer than
the marines in the Assassinorum boxset. They fit in nicely with the Guardsmen and the Rogue Psykers. I wouldn't say
they're anything special, but have enough detail on them, so they stand out from the rest of the army.

### Base

I mixed sand with glue and applied it to the base. I then drybrushed it with Eshin Grey, then Mechanicus Standard Grey.
I then painted the outer base with Rhinox Hide.

## Roundup

These were fairly simple to paint in the end. Lots of red and bronze, with a bit of black and silver and the odd detail.

Something I need to watch out for in the future is highlighting larger red panels. After applying the wash the red was
a really deep crimson. The more I highlighted the less saturation there was, becoming more and more faded. Applying a
red glaze might be what's needed to bring that depth of colour back, or maybe I just need to find some different red
paints.
