## Miniature Review

There are only two Space Marines in the box. The sculpts I believe are unique to the box, and look a lot nicer than
the marines in the Assassinorum boxset. They fit in nicely with the Guardsmen and the Rogue Psykers. I wouldn't say
they're anything special, but have enough detail on them, so they stand out from the rest of the army.

## Painting Techniques

### Steel
<Paint name={'Iron Warriors'} />

### Bronze
<Paint name={'Hashut Copper'} />

### Black Leather
<Paint name={'Black Legion'} />

### Brown Leather
<Paint name={'Garaghaks Sewer'} />

### Armour
<Paint name={'Baal Red'} />

### Skin
<Paint name={'Guilliman Flesh'} />

### Horns
<Paint name={'Skeleton Horde'} />

### Base

I mixed sand with glue and applied it to the base. I then drybrushed it with Eshin Grey, then Mechanicus Standard Grey.
I then painted the outer base with Rhinox Hide.
