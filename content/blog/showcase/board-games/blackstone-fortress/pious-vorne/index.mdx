## Miniature Review

I'm sure I've got some old Zealots somewhere that used to be a part of my Grey Knight army, lead by an Inquisitor. I
really like the new wide stance and huge weapon, but I feel like old miniatures stood out with their crazed expressions.
This new Zealot has a fairly smooth, dull expression in comparison.

Something that is great about the miniature is that for a non-marine the armour actually looks suitable for a flamer
weapon. I feel like most would be extremely unprotected and wouldn't be able to withstand the heat. This Zealot has
a heavy leather jacket, multiple layers, metal plates and a rebreather. Flames always look pretty cool too!

### Base

I mixed sand with glue and applied it to the base. I then drybrushed it with Eshin Grey, then Mechanicus Standard Grey.
I then painted the outer base with Rhinox Hide.

## Roundup

I tried to keep a really dark tone on the metallics and leather to simulate the soot that would be created from the
flamer. I kept the colorscheme fairly simple too, as there's not a huge amount of detail compared to the other hero
miniatures.

I'm mostly happy with how the flames came out. Using contrast paints made it easy to create fairly smooth transitions,
and the colors are nice and vibrant. Something to remember for the future!
