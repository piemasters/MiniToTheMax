## Miniature Review

UR-025 was as far as I'm aware the only Men of Iron miniature to be released by Games Workshop before the Votann
release. They've done a good job on the sculpt, making him big and intimidating compared to the other adventurers.

All the smooth edges feels fairly unique, part way between a Space Marine and a Kastelan Robot. A bit more elegant that
anything from the 40,000 millennium. I would love to see a full army following this theme, with even bigger and more
complex units!

## Roundup

This was a really quick paint job, only taking a couple of hours. I really love the oxide wash, I need to paint an army
using it in the future! Maybe a matching Votann army?

I could add some further highlights to the spot colours, but I don't want to detract from the main armour, head and
weapons. I also really want to move on and get all the characters finished, as it's all starting to look great together
now.
