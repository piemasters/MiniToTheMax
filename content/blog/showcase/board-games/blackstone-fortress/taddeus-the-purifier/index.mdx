## Miniature Review

Taddeus the Purifier looks like a futuristic space Pope. He's well built with a large flowing robe and a bionic hand.
He doesn't bother with a gun, instead depending on a servo-skull. This frees him up to preach with his holy book while
he bashes enemies of the imperium with him mighty mace.

I really like the design. It looks very regal but hasn't gone overboard on the details. His face and book really draw
your attention, then the servo-skull and bionic hand draw focus and it makes you want to search around further to find
more missed pieces of interest.

## Roundup

The robe came out great and I'm really glad, as I think if it's not right the rest of the paint job would fall apart.
The reds and golds go really nicely for the regal look, and the mace and servo-skull being mostly silver helps to
blend them into the background. This helps to keep the focus on the face and book.

Not only am I happy with the finish, but I did achieved it spending less time on highlights. Normally after applying
the wash I reapply the base color before applying highlights to help with blending. I skipped that step this time
and it looks just as good, so I will cut down on doing that in the future.
