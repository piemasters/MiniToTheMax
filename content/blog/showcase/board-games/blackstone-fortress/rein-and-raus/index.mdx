## Miniature Review

It's an interesting idea having a unit of two count as a single hero to play in a board game like this. It gives the
game a different feel and also looks great on the board wit the two working really well together. It's also great that
they're ratlings as you hardly see them any more.

I really like these miniatures as they've got a lot of detail on them, but nothing that is too complex. A pouch with
some bread, sausages and an apple is a nice touch. The medic box, dynamite, mines, bolt cutters, grapple hook and two
way radio really make them feel fully equipped to take on anything. Their expressions are great too.

## Roundup

I really enjoyed painting these guys as they're mostly made up of soft materials or metallics so are super quick to
paint with contrast and metallic paints. I like the highlight of the white medic box and the green spot color for the
lenses against the more muted camo green of the shirts and armour.

Finally that's the last of the box set completed! I'll post some photos next week of everything together, then it's onto
the next project!
