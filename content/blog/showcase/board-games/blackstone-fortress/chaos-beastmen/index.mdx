> Beastmen are destined to become the outcasts of Imperial society. They are shunned and are often hunted down and
> killed as the Imperium has little tolerance for any who deviate from the perfection of the baseline human form in
> mind or body. Mutation is considered a heretical crime against the Emperor of Mankind by Imperial authorities because
> of its connection to sympathy with or worship of Chaos.
