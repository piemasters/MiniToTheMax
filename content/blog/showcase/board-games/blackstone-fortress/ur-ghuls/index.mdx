## Miniature Review

Onto another board game, this time a more recent one. Blackstone Fortress came out November 2018, but was seemingly
discontinued in early 2021 which is when I picked it up just in case. There's a lot of unique miniatures in the box
that I didn't want to miss out on, and now I'm actually getting around to painting them!

I'm starting off with the Ur-Ghuls as they seem fairly simple to paint and have nice open poses. They really add a
creepy vibe to the box which is great!

## Painting Techniques

### Skin
<Paint name={'Briar Queen Chill'} />
<Paint name={'Drakenhof Nightshade'} />
<Paint name={'Druchii Violet'} />
<Paint name={'Etherium Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Praxeti White'} />

### Base

I mixed sand with glue and applied it to the base. I then drybrushed it with Eshin Grey, then Mechanicus Standard Grey.
I then painted the outer base with Rhinox Hide.

## Roundup

With the recent release of the new contrast and shade paints I really wanted to try some out. The ones I used weren't
particularly exciting, but they did the job. I was really impressed by how much good the miniatures look after applying
the same paints to the entire thing and not really picking out any details. Off to a really quick start!
