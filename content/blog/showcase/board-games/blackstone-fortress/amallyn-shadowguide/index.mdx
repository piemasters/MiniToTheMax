## Miniature Review

Amallyn is the first Eldar, or Aeldari, that I've painted in a long long time. I really like the pose, with a wide
stance and the position of the sniper rifle. The mandatory ranger cloak allows for a lot more color to be added to the
miniature and adds some depth.

I mixed sand with glue and applied it to the base. I then drybrushed it with Eshin Grey, then Mechanicus Standard Grey.
I then painted the outer base with Rhinox Hide.

## Roundup

As I'm getting to the end of the box this one felt like a bit of a rushed job. I'm not always happy with how contrast
paints cover smooth areas, and quite often end up adding so many highlights that I've fully covered up the base layer.
This time I only added a few smaller highlights, in some areas it looks fine foo a fraction of the time, in others
though its not the best.

One of the bits I am really happy about though is the cloak. I'd actually planned to paint a thorn patten all over it,
but I was so happy with how the color and the shading came out I wasn't sure if I messed up if I'd be able to
reproduce it, so I decided to leave it as it is.
