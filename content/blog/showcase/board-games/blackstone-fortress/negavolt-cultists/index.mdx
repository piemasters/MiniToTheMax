> Negavolt Cultists are Heretek Cults that are often found on worlds controlled by the Adeptus Mechanicus.
> They express their devotion to the Ruinous Powers by despoiling machinery, corrupting the function of technologies
> through daemonic inovacations and rituals.
>
> Negavolt Cultists wire themselves with empathic-resonance coils that act as batteries that charge their own pain and
> hatred. At full capacity, these spinally fused cells fire arcs of warp-infused energy at their enemies. An anarchic
> electric field also builds around the dendrites that the cultist implant in their skulls, creating a halo of lighting.

## Miniature Review

I've never picked up any Mechanicus units before so the Negavolt Cultists look completely unique to me. On first look
you see the human silhouette, but the more you look the less human they look. The most obvious features being the huge
plasma coils on their backs and the almost snake-like cables shooting out of their skulls.

The poses are a little flat, but other than that they look great and the cattle prod like weapons are pretty cool
being dual handed. Maybe not the most dangerous at a distance but you wouldn't want to get up close to these guys!

I mixed sand with glue and applied it to the base. I then drybrushed it with Eshin Grey, then Mechanicus Standard Grey.
I then painted the outer base with Rhinox Hide.

## Roundup

These guys were really different to paint compared to the rest of the units. Although a number of the colours match the
others, the skin and the yellow wires really make them stand out. It was fun to paint really sickly skin, as well as
completely unique weapons.

After painting these I really want to pick up some mechanicus miniatures in the future!
