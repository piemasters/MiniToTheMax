> Rogue Psykers are Human Psykers that now belong to the Forces of Chaos. Many have eluded either the Inquisition's
> Ordo Hereticus or the Adeptus Astra Telepathica's League of Black Ships and have become tainted by the Gods of Chaos,
> a process which drives the psyker completely insane. Their powers are completely out of control, capable of causing
> mass destruction but also making the psyker himself prone to possession by Daemons.

## Miniature Review

These guys add some height to the box, and it's great to see something different compared to the usual cultists and
Space Marines. I like the use of the chains, allowing them to float above the ground while keeping them held down to
the base.

The stand-out feature of them has to be the bulging brains. Along with the poses and staves they make it really clear
that they're psykers, rather than just random mutations. It gives them a demonic or even xenos look at first, it's
only when you look in more detail that you realise that they're actually human!

I mixed sand with glue and applied it to the base. I then drybrushed it with Eshin Grey, then Mechanicus Standard Grey.
