> Rogue Psykers are Human Psykers that now belong to the Forces of Chaos. Many have eluded either the Inquisition's
> Ordo Hereticus or the Adeptus Astra Telepathica's League of Black Ships and have become tainted by the Gods of Chaos,
> a process which drives the psyker completely insane. Their powers are completely out of control, capable of causing
> mass destruction but also making the psyker himself prone to possession by Daemons.

## Miniature Review

These guys add some height to the box, and it's great to see something different compared to the usual cultists and
Space Marines. I like the use of the chains, allowing them to float above the ground while keeping them held down to
the base.

The stand-out feature of them has to be the bulging brains. Along with the poses and staves they make it really clear
that they're psykers, rather than just random mutations. It gives them a demonic or even xenos look at first, it's
only when you look in more detail that you realise that they're actually human!

## Roundup

I really wanted the focus of these guys to be the massively bulging heads. I spent most of my time working on the skin,
then wanted to add a little something more to make them stand out. As I'd already started using green as a spot colour,
I decided to give them green magical eyes.

With the green eyes added I thought it wasn't enough, so added more green to their hands and their staves to show the
power erupting from them. It's a cool detail that I think really stands out and makes them look like a lot more than
just a floating guardsman.
