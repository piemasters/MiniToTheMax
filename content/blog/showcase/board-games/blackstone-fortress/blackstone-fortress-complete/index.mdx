> As vast and dark as a sunless void, the Blackstone Fortress is a creation far beyond the ken of any race in the

## Painting Techniques

### Black Leather

<Paint name={'Black Legion'} />

I mixed sand with glue and applied it to the base. I then drybrushed it with Eshin Grey, then Mechanicus Standard Grey.
I then painted the outer base with Rhinox Hide.
