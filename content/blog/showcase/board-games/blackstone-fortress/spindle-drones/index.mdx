## Miniature Review

Next up in the box, the second easiest to paint seem to be the spindle drones! As with the Ur-Ghuls they add a nice
creepy vibe to the box, and have a unique shape compared to anything else Games Workshop makes. They remind me of
something from Destiny.

My only criticism is that they don't feel that imposing due to their size. I saw the larger Guardian Drones that
came out as part of the Ascension expansion. They're the perfect size, and I wish they came as standard. Too bad
they're no longer in production and sell for crazy prices online.

### Base

I mixed sand with glue and applied it to the base. I then drybrushed it with Eshin Grey, then Mechanicus Standard Grey.
I then painted the outer base with Rhinox Hide.
