## Miniature Review

Next up in the box, the second easiest to paint seem to be the spindle drones! As with the Ur-Ghuls they add a nice
creepy vibe to the box, and have a unique shape compared to anything else Games Workshop makes. They remind me of
something from Destiny.

My only criticism is that they don't feel that imposing due to their size. I saw the larger Guardian Drones that
came out as part of the Ascension expansion. They're the perfect size, and I wish they came as standard. Too bad
they're no longer in production and sell for crazy prices online.

## Painting Techniques

### Legs
<Paint name={'Black Legion'} />
<Paint name={'Thunderhawk Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Russ Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Fenrisian Grey'} />

### Carapace
<Paint name={'Grey Seer'} />
<Paint name={'Pylar Glacier'} />
<Paint name={'Drakenhof Nightshade'} />
<Paint name={'Wrack White'} />

### Lenses
<Paint name={'Luxion Purple'} />
<Paint name={'Kakophoni Purple'} />
<Paint name={'White Scar'} />

### Base

I mixed sand with glue and applied it to the base. I then drybrushed it with Eshin Grey, then Mechanicus Standard Grey.
I then painted the outer base with Rhinox Hide.

## Roundup

I kept these nice and simple, so I can push through the boxset quickly. For only using a few colours they came out
nicely, the only thing I'm not fully happy about is the final carapace drybrush. I think it would have looked a lot
better as a wet blend, but I didn't want to spend any more time on them.
