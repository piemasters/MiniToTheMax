## Miniature Review

Dahyak Greekh is a Kroot Tracker, and my first T'au! I really like the ranger theme, and just how different he is to
Amallyn Shadowguide, the Asuryani Ranger despite having a similar role. It's also nice to see him covered almost fully
in leather, rather than the usual armour plates. It helps to make him stand out in the crowd.

His pose holding the rifle looks really natural and open, which I like. My only concern is there feels like a lot of
detail happening behind the gun strap and cloak, making it harder to paint as well as less noticeable.

I mixed sand with glue and applied it to the base. I then drybrushed it with Eshin Grey, then Mechanicus Standard Grey.
I then painted the outer base with Rhinox Hide.

## Roundup

Dahyak was fairly easy to paint, I could have spent some extra time highlighting but if anything I was worried I'd make
parts look worse rather than better. Contrast paints can create a really nice effect sometimes on softer materials and
you need to spend a lot of time when adding to it to keep that smooth effect.
