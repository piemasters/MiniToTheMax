## Miniature Review

When I said the Vindicare Assassin has a boring pose this is what I'm comparing it to. Although the Callidus is far
from stealthy I love the pose of her charging in ready to strike. I used to have the older miniature and had it based
in a similar way on a tall base.

I'm not fully sure how I feel about the hair. It's kept the same style as the previous iteration, but I think it makes
the miniature look too tall and slim. I'm not sure if a more flowing style had looked better, or just having it flow in
a slightly different way.

highlight.

### Base

I mixed sand with glue and applied it to the base. I then drybrushed it with Dawnstone, then Administratum Grey.
I then painted the outer base with Rhinox Hide, then added a layer of Mournfang Brown.
Finally, I applied some grass tufts and some

## Roundup

The miniature is a lot simpler compared to the others, so was pretty quick to paint. I really like how the weapons
contrast with the rest of the miniature, both the brightness and the colour.

I went quite bright again on the armour, but I think it was necessary as most of the detail found on the mini is the
curves of the suit.
