> Assassinorum: Execution Force gives four Imperial Assassins an incredibly important mission - slay Chaos Lord Drask
> before his dark ritual brings about the end of the Imperium itself!

I've not played the game since I first bought it years ago so for now I'm not going to go into any depth around
how the game works or how good or bad it is. All I can say is the boards look great and the game looks so much better
with all the miniatures painted.

So for now I'll just leave you guys with some photos of everything laid out on the game boards. Maybe one day
I'll get around to giving it a proper play-through and can leave a more detailed review then.
