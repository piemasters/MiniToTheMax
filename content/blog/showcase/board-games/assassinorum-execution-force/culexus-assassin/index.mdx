## Miniature Review

The last of the assassins and the last mini in the box! The Culexus is pretty plain compared to the other assassins.
No big weapon and no crazy pose. He does have a skull helm like the Eversor, although much larger with weaponry
jutting out of it.

They are meant to be the most sinister of the assassins, and I think the lack of weaponry, the skulls smile and the
hunched pose really pulls this off.

After applying the Agrax Earthshade wash I mixed Dryad Bark 1:1 with Balor Brown and applied several thin layers to
highlight.

### Base

I mixed sand with glue and applied it to the base. I then drybrushed it with Dawnstone, then Administratum Grey.
I then painted the outer base with Rhinox Hide, then added a layer of Mournfang Brown.
Finally, I applied some grass tufts and some

## Roundup

As with the Eversor I kept with a fairly limited colour palette. The main aim with this guy was to ensure he fit in with
all the others. I think he matches well, although it was hard to resist making the weapon on his helm more dominant.
