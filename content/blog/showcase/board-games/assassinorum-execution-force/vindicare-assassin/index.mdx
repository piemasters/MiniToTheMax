## Miniature Review

The Vindicare was the first assassin miniature I had back in the 90s and is largely what lead me to buy this boxset in
the first place. I've always liked the Inquisition and the Officio Assassinorum, so always used to run them alongside
my Space Wolves or Grey Knights.

The Vindicare is always what I think of first when assassins come up. The sniper gives him a great silhouette and the
syn-skin gives him a rally sinister look, while still appearing fully human. Having various ammo strapped all over his
body is also a nice touch, showing how prepared he is for any target.

My only criticism of the miniature is that he's fairly boring compared to the others. I think the older mini had a
cooler pose, and all the others in the box are far more dynamic. Something more stealthy would have been great.

## Roundup

I've always struggled with highlighting black, as if you go too dark you lose all the details of the miniature.
However, if you go too bright it stops looking black and tends to just look grey.

I decided to go with blue-greys this time and slowly highlighted up. Although I think I still overdid it I'm happy
with the effect as it looks a lot more realistic. At some point in the future I might decide to apply a wash or dark
glaze to the amour, which hopefully will help tone down the highlights and blend everything together a bit nicer. For
npow though I don't want to mess up and ruin all the highlighting work I've done, so I'll leave it how it is and try
to improve on the next ones!
