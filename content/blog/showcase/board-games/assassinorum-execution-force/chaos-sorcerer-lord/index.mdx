## Miniature Review

Although in the game the sorcerer is a named character Drask, the miniature is a generic Chaos Lord that you choose
how to assemble. Despite this I really like the final build as he looks huge, even with the new primaris marines.

It's got some nice touches, with the impaled Dark Angel and Tyranid head, as well as the handing book and huge fur
cloak. He also comes with a cute little familiar, what's not to love?

### Base

I mixed sand with glue and applied it to the base. I then drybrushed it with Dawnstone, then Administratum Grey.
I then painted the outer base with Rhinox Hide, then added a layer of Mournfang Brown.
Finally, I applied some grass tufts and some

## Roundup

The colour scheme used on the marines really suits the sorcerer, and I used a lot more of the green spot colour to
really set him apart.

Now the Chaos forces are used, onto the assassins!
