## Miniature Review

Sticking with the clutches of Chaos the three Space Marines are next. These are some pretty ancient and boring sculpts
compared to the releases of today, so I don't plan to spend much time on them. The main thing is that they need to match
the much cooler sorcerer lord that I plan to paint next!

I mixed sand with glue and applied it to the base. I then drybrushed it with Dawnstone, then Administratum Grey.
I then painted the outer base with Rhinox Hide, then added a layer of Mournfang Brown.
Finally, I applied some grass tufts and some

## Roundup

There wasn't much exciting about painting these guys, I did a little highlighting on the armour after doing the same
when painting Lost Patrol and I think I'm slowly improving. I've not added anything to their shoulder pads for now
as I'm not 100% sure what to use and don't want to have to replace them down the line if I decide to collect and paint
a matching army of Chaos Space Marines.
