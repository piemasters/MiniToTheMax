> Chaos Cultists are the mortal devotees of the Dark Gods, ordinary men and women fallen to promises of temporal

> overwhelming even determined enemies through sheer weight of numbers.

## Miniature Review

Onto the next project... another old board game Assassinorum: Execution Force. I've had these miniatures looking at me
unpainted for the last 7 years, so it seems long overdue that I get them all painted.

I'm starting with the cultists as I have some I started years ago and wished I went with a different colour scheme.
This is my chance to test how I thought I should have done it years ago, but I want to try and keep the number of
paints limited, so it doesn't take too long as there are 15 of them.

At the time these cultists were fairly new miniatures and I thought looked pretty cool. I think they've dated a bit now,
but they're still pretty decent for rank and file troops. There's 3 of each pose so they look different enough when
mixed up.

### Base

I mixed sand with glue and applied it to the base. I then drybrushed it with Dawnstone, then Administratum Grey.
I then painted the outer base with Rhinox Hide, then added a layer of Mournfang Brown.
Finally, I applied some grass tufts and some

## Roundup

I've not done a huge amount of highlighting large areas of black in the past. I really like my choice of colours but
think I may have gone a bit overboard on the brightness. I could apply a shade to try and bring it back down to black,
but at this point I don't want to ruin them and have to redo anything.

As for the colour scheme I'm pretty happy with it. I could have picked out some extra colours, or changed the colours
of hoods, but for keeping it simple it's worked well and they look great on the board as a group.
