## Miniature Review

The Eversor is perhaps the most standout of all the assassins. The skull helm really pops in contrast to his black suit,
and his pose jumping off a wall is great. This is how I want more miniatures to look.

The claws pair really well with his skull helm and large needle, truly sinister. The poison coursing through all his
weapons also helps to tie everything together.

After applying the Agrax Earthshade wash I mixed Dryad Bark 1:1 with Balor Brown and applied several thin layers to
highlight.

### Base

I mixed sand with glue and applied it to the base. I then drybrushed it with Dawnstone, then Administratum Grey.
I then painted the outer base with Rhinox Hide, then added a layer of Mournfang Brown.
Finally, I applied some grass tufts and some

## Roundup

The Eversor was more detailed than the other assassins, so I decided to keep to a fairly limited colour palette. It
really helps to tie him in with the other assassins. The red doesn't make him look the most stealthy, but it does
suit the mini and stops the fully black suit blending into the background.
