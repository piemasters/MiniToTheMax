## Miniature Review

For the final miniature in the box I left Redarg, the most corrupted of them all. Between the face and horns that
strongly resemble Khorne and the skin tattoos on his chest and back he barely looks human.

Once again he is equipped with an enormous weapon and despite his pose being static it is very menacing. Something I've
really enjoyed with this box is each miniature could easily pose as a hero of a warband and are certainly not just rank
and file troops.

After my last attempt I decided to play it safe and just stick with the blood effect on the weapons. I spent a bit more
time applying thin stippled paint to the areas where the blood faded away, and I think it's resulted in a much more
natural effect.

## Basing

After gluing the miniature to the base I mixed sand with glue and applied it around their feet. Normally I apply the
glue first, then sprinkle the sand on top, but this way I found you get much fresher mud look. I then base-coated it
with Rhinox Hide, then applied highlights of Mournfang Brown and Steel Legion Drab, then a wash of Agrax Earthshade.

Afterwards I applied some Citadel Scorched Grass in patches as well as some
[Leaf Litter](http://www.greenstuffworld.com/en/model-leaves/277-leaf-scatter-litter-natural-leaves.html)
by Green Stuff World and gave them and the grass a final wash of Agrax Earthshade.

## Roundup

I think the blood effect on the axe is the best I've managed so far. These guys were fun to experiment on and for the
time I spent on them I'm happy with how they all came out. I'll have to see if I ever come back to expand this unit or
even start a new army. If I do I'll defiantly go a bit more crazy with the blood effects, blood for the blood god after
all!
