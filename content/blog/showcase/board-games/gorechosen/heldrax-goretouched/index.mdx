## Miniature Review

This guy looks like a giant. Despite Fexgore being around the same size, because Heldrax doesn't have the armour he
looks lankier, and with the crazy huge axe he just looks that bit taller.

The real standout feature though is the horns growing out from his exposed spine. They frame the face, really nicely and
just give so much unique detail to the back of the miniature where you realise where the horns are coming from.

I went with a similar approach to last time and applied the gore thickly to the weapon, but built up thin layers on the
skin around the spine to create a sore dripping effect.

## Basing

After gluing the miniature to the base I mixed sand with glue and applied it around their feet. Normally I apply the
glue first, then sprinkle the sand on top, but this way I found you get much fresher mud look. I then base-coated it
with Rhinox Hide, then applied highlights of Mournfang Brown and Steel Legion Drab, then a wash of Agrax Earthshade.

Afterwards I applied some Citadel Scorched Grass in patches as well as some
[Leaf Litter](http://www.greenstuffworld.com/en/model-leaves/277-leaf-scatter-litter-natural-leaves.html)
by Green Stuff World and gave them and the grass a final wash of Agrax Earthshade.

## Roundup

Despite having the same colour palette as the others in the box this guy was a lot of fun to paint, as there was a lot
more detail on him than I first thought, with all the trinkets attached to his skin, and the detail on the spine.

That's 3 finished now and only two more to go!
