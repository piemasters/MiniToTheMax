## Miniature Review

I really like the stance of this miniature. It's a really strong pose with weapons held low as he eyes up his next
opponent. Despite having the static stance, the chain adds a touch of movement showing he hasn't paused for long.

Both his weapons are huge, but his build makes it seem like he is well able to wield them. The armour also
gives him a bit of height, so he doesn't look too small compared to the Slaughterpriests. The skull helm also adds
to the sinister look.

### Gore
1. Layer: Blood For The Blood God

After last time, I mostly focused the blood effects on the weapons. I applied a very liberal coat, stippling it on in
the areas where I wanted to fade out. I then applied a second layer to the ends of the weapons where the blood would
coat thickest.

## Basing

With the miniature glued to the base I mixed sand with glue and applied it to the base, creating a wet mud like effect.
I then base-coated it with Rhinox Hide, applied highlights of Mournfang Brown and Steel Legion Drab, then applied a wash
of Agrax Earthshade.

Finally, I applied some Citadel Scorched Grass in patches as well as some
[Leaf Litter](http://www.greenstuffworld.com/en/model-leaves/277-leaf-scatter-litter-natural-leaves.html)
by Green Stuff World and then applied a light wash of Agrax Earthshade over the leaves.

## Roundup

Overall I think the blood effects came out better, although I'm still not fully happy in a few areas where it sharply
fades away. The problem I had was the more I messed with it the worse I made it, so I decided to leave it as is for now.

I'm really happy with the skull as it's just bright enough to draw focus, but dirty and chaotic enough. The red armour
also looks well aged, although the bronze could use a few scratches to add a little extra shine. Something to focus on
in the future!
