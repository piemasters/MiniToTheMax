## Miniature Review

Ok so in my last post when I said about the Pink Horrors being big, this guy is a true monster! Normally when
photographing miniatures you're doing so from just off-centre from the front. With this guy the most interesting details
are arguably on his back with all the tattoos. With him looking to the side it allows you to get the face in clearly
with the tattoos running up the arm all in shot.

The tattoos are definitely needed, otherwise it would be quite a plain mini. I would have loved for the staff to have
been held with a more open pose, as in its current state despite the size he feels very closed up, hiding some detail.

## Painting Techniques

For the skin I used a similar approach to the Pink Horrors, starting with a white basecoat and building up using
different blues and then finally black for the backs of the arms, legs and the base of the tail. This gave a nice smooth
look and adds some contrast tyo the miniature.

I also used the same technique for the flames using Hexwraith Flame, and for the gold armour. To add a bit of contrast
to the colours I decided to paint the hair a bright reddish orange. I started with a deep red and drybrushed lighter and
lighter shades of red and then into orange. Having the beard and eyes the same colour it helps to draw your eye to his
face.

For the tattoos I filled them in bright white as I wanted them to really take center stage. I then tried to fade the
skin surrounding them from white to the existing dark blue to give a glowing effect. This was done using several
light blues, and a lot of wet blending.

Instructions for the bases can be found [here](/showcase/board-games/silver-tower/kairic-acolytes/).

## Roundup

Although maybe not my favorite sculpt, I love the size of this guy, and I'm happy with the contrast between the white,
red and dark blue. It draws your eye to the different points of interest. The colours help tie him in with the other
miniatures in the box as well.
