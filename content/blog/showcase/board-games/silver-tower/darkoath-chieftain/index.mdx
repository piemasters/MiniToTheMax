## Miniature Review

So this is easily my favorite miniature of the box! It had to be, owners of the original HeroQuest and Warhammer Quest
will know that the barbarian was the real selling point of the game. The focal character on the box artwork and the
character everyone wants to play when they first pickup the game.

Because of this you can see how much extra detail has gone into this model compared to the ones before it. Although
static, the pose is really wide and intimidating and makes for great photos. The way the sword is sculpted is really
great, making it easy to add light reflections, preventing it from becoming a plain flat surface. I also really like
the face as well as the hands, it's amazing how fine they've been able to make the details.

## Roundup

I think this one will be hard to beat. I'm really happy with how the skin and blades came out. It's been really great
spending time on more organic materials rather than painting Space Marines all the time. If I wanted to improve the
paint job in the future I'd probably focus on the bone areas. I could add a bit more contrast with a dirtier look, as
well as a big more highlighting and blending on the horn.
