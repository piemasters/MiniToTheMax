## Miniature Review

When it comes to dwarfs I've always liked slayers. I always think back to the old Toll and Giant slayers. Half looking
fearsome, while the other half look terrified. My favorite was always the dwarf trying to peer up high into the sky to
see his giant opposition in the face.

Looking back at those miniatures things really have come a long way. The length of the hair helps prevent him looking
too small when compared to the rest of the party, and along with his beard and runes on his back gives a lot of
opportunity to add some colour.

## Roundup

It wasn't too dissimilar painting the Fyreslayer compared to the Darkoath Chieftain. They compliment each other, despite
the dwarf being painted with a much warmer palette. I'm happy with the torch in the axe, a reminder back to the original
game where you had to decide who was going to be the torch-bearer throughout the dungeon exploration.
