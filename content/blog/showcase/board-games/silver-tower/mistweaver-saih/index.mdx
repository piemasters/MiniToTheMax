> Able to turn the minds of her enemies against them, the Mistweaver Saih is a sinister figure hailing from the Realm
> of Shadow. Very little else is known about her, and her emotions, motivations and allegiances are impossible to
> understand. The only other certainty is that she is an immensely powerful enchantress, disturbingly serene in the
> centre of her storms of illusory horror and violent bloodshed.

## Miniature Review

The Mistweaver Saih is a pretty unique miniature. There aren't many Aelves like her, or any miniatures in fact with the
floating stance. With the eerie smoke and face-mask she's almost resembles a Nighthaunt. I really hope to see more minis
with this kind of stance in the future to help bring more of a sense of movement into everything.

## Roundup

Having recently painted the bold, large detailed Warpriest and Knight Questor it was quite a contrast to paint quite a
delicate model with a lot of smaller details. I liked how the cloak came out on the Knight Questor, so I went for a
similar style here.

With that I'm down to one final model left to paint to complete the box!
