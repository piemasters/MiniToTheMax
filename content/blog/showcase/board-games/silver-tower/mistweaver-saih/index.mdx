> Able to turn the minds of her enemies against them, the Mistweaver Saih is a sinister figure hailing from the Realm
> of Shadow. Very little else is known about her, and her emotions, motivations and allegiances are impossible to
> understand. The only other certainty is that she is an immensely powerful enchantress, disturbingly serene in the
> centre of her storms of illusory horror and violent bloodshed.

## Miniature Review

The Mistweaver Saih is a pretty unique miniature. There aren't many Aelves like her, or any miniatures in fact with the
floating stance. With the eerie smoke and face-mask she's almost resembles a Nighthaunt. I really hope to see more minis
with this kind of stance in the future to help bring more of a sense of movement into everything.

<Paint name={'Terradon Turquoise'} />
<Paint name={'Lothern Blue'} />

Leave the recesses when applying the Terradon Turquoise. Focus on the raised areas with the Lothern Blue and only
apply the Baharroth Blue to the sharpest edges. Apply the Corax White very thinly along the middle of the sharpest
edges.

### Smoke

<Paint name={'Nighthaunt Gloom'} />

### White
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />
<Paint name={'Terradon Turquoise'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

The Terradon Turquoise was used very thinly at the edges.

Instructions for the bases can be found [here](/showcase/board-games/silver-tower/kairic-acolytes/).

## Roundup

Having recently painted the bold, large detailed Warpriest and Knight Questor it was quite a contrast to paint quite a
delicate model with a lot of smaller details. I liked how the cloak came out on the Knight Questor, so I went for a
similar style here.

With that I'm down to one final model left to paint to complete the box!
