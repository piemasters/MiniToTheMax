## Miniature Review

I think these were a brand-new race to release within Silver Tower. If ot I don't remember seeing any miniatures of
them at the very least. They're a weird combination, part human, part beast, part bird and all Chaos!

It's always great o see something new, and I also love the armour. It's really detailed with unique shapes and even has
some different surfaces to make for a fun painting challenge. There's even some room for some small amounts of freehand
detail with the eye gems.

## Painting Techniques

### Skin

I used the same technique for the skin as I did on the
[Ogroid Thaumaturge](/showcase/board-games/silver-tower/ogroid-thaumaturge/), although I kept with the lighter range of
blues as I wanted to keep them a lot paler.

### Armour

The gold is the usual Retributor Armour with an Agrax Earthshade wash, then highlighted with Liberator Gold and
a final drybrush of Golden Griffon. The silver was Leadbelcher washed with Nuln Oil, then highlighted with
Runefang Steel and and final drybrush of Necron Compound.

The turquoise plate was given a base layer of Terradon Turquoise and a wash of Coelia Greenshade. It
was then highlighted back up using Terradon Turquoise, then focussing away from the edges using Lothern Blue and
Baharroth Blue. I then gave it a final layer of Ardcoat to give the armour a shine.

### Bone

The bone is Ushabti Bone, highlighted with Morghast Bone, then given a heavy Agrax Earthshade wash, then highlighted
again using Morghast Bone.

### Robes, Spines & Gems

The robes were base coated with Khorne Red, then highlighted with Mephiston Red and Evil Sunz Scarlet, then given an
Agrax Earthshade wash. Once dry I highlighted the raised areas back up using the two lighter colours.

The pink spines were layered using Pink Horror, Emperors Children and Fulgrim Pink then given a light wash of
Carroburg Crimson.

The gems were given a Warpstone Glow basecoat, then highlighted up to white using Moot Green and gradually
mixing in more white. I used Ardcoat once again to finish them off with a shine.

Instructions for the bases can be found [here](/showcase/board-games/silver-tower/kairic-acolytes/).

## Roundup

I'm glad to have finally finished the larger units now and can start moving onto the characters. These were really fun
to paint with a lot of different colours. It'll be interesting to see if they release these miniatures as a wider range.
