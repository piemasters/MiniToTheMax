> Standing high in the favour of Tzeentch, Gaunt Summoners are sorcerers capable of shifting the tide of battle
> single-handedly. Luckily for Sigmar and his allies, there exist only nine of these immensely powerful beings.
> Each has been gifted with a changestaff, and a key to one of the nine Silver Towers â€“ lairs of hidden knowledge
> filled with secrets and traps. On the battlefield, they call forth daemons from the Realm of Chaos, engulf foes
> in sheets of flame and simply stab those who get too near with a mutation-causing warptongue blade.

## Miniature Review

The Gaunt Summoner is a fairly large miniature, his height marking him out as the big baddie of the box.
The many eyes along the stretched U shape head give him a real creepy chaotic look. The armour and feathers tie him in
with the Tzaangors and Kairic Acolytes and the flames tie in with the horrors. He has a great open pose making it easy
to see all the various details on him from the front.

He comes along with 4 pairs of familiars. They're a great take on the old miniatures you can see painted
[here](https://www.ninjabread.co.uk/tzeentch-familiars-old-and-new/]), adding some real character to the game.

## Painting Techniques

### Skin
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />
<Paint name={'Lothern Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Teclis Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Caledor Sky'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

The Lothern Blue was heavily watered down and applied over all skin. The Teclis Blue and Caledor Sky were also heavily
watered down and applied to the recesses. The Corax White was applied very thinly to the raised areas.

### Gold
<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Liberator Gold'} />

### Silver
<Paint name={'Leadbelcher'} />
<Paint name={'Nuln Oil'} />
<Paint name={'Leadbelcher'} />
<Paint name={'Runefang Steel'} />
<Paint name={'Necron Compound'} />

### Armour
<Paint name={'Terradon Turquoise'} />
<Paint name={'Coelia Greenshade'} />
<Paint name={'Terradon Turquoise'} />
<Paint name={'Lothern Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Baharroth Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Ardcoat'} />

I avoided the edges with the Terradon Turquoise, then focused further away from the edges with the Lothern Blue
and Baharroth Blue.

### Cloak
<Paint name={'Thousand Sons Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Caledor Sky'} />
<Paint name={'Druchii Violet'} />
<Paint name={'Daemonette Hide'} />
<Paint name={'Dechala Lilac'} />

For the Druchii Violet I applied several layers, adding more to the bottom of the clock each time.

### Demon Flesh
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />
<Paint name={'Screamer Pink'} />
<Paint name={'Pink Horror'} />
<Paint name={'Emperors Children'} />
<Paint name={'Fulgrim Pink'} />

The Screamer Pink was watered down heavily.

### Book pages
<Paint name={'Morghast Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Rakarth Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />

### Blacks
<Paint name={'Corvus Black'} />
<Paint name={'Mechanicus Standard Grey'} />
<Paint name={'Warpstone Glow'} />
<Paint name={'Moot Green'} />

### Feathers
<Paint name={'Warpstone Glow'} />
<Paint name={'Screamer Pink'} />
<Paint name={'Moot Green'} />
<Paint name={'Pink Horror'} />
<Paint name={'Emperors Children'} />

The Warpstone Glow was applied to the top half, with the Screamer Pink applied to the bottom half, blending the two.
The Moot Green and Pink Horror were used to highlight the outer edges of their respective colours, then a final layer
of Emperors Children was added to the very edge of the pink.

### Flame
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />
<Paint name={'Hexwraith Flame'} />

Instructions for the bases can be found [here](/showcase/board-games/silver-tower/kairic-acolytes/).

## Roundup

It was great to paint a mix of small, brightly coloured minis and even give some freehand a go on the books.
I'm happy with how the Gaunt Summoner came out as well, he fits in with the rest of the Chaos units in the box,
but is bright enough to stand out.

That's all the bad guys finished, now onto the heroes!
