> Standing high in the favour of Tzeentch, Gaunt Summoners are sorcerers capable of shifting the tide of battle
> single-handedly. Luckily for Sigmar and his allies, there exist only nine of these immensely powerful beings.
> Each has been gifted with a changestaff, and a key to one of the nine Silver Towers â€“ lairs of hidden knowledge
> filled with secrets and traps. On the battlefield, they call forth daemons from the Realm of Chaos, engulf foes
> in sheets of flame and simply stab those who get too near with a mutation-causing warptongue blade.

## Miniature Review

The Gaunt Summoner is a fairly large miniature, his height marking him out as the big baddie of the box.
The many eyes along the stretched U shape head give him a real creepy chaotic look. The armour and feathers tie him in
with the Tzaangors and Kairic Acolytes and the flames tie in with the horrors. He has a great open pose making it easy
to see all the various details on him from the front.

He comes along with 4 pairs of familiars. They're a great take on the old miniatures you can see painted
[here](https://www.ninjabread.co.uk/tzeentch-familiars-old-and-new/]), adding some real character to the game.

## Roundup

It was great to paint a mix of small, brightly coloured minis and even give some freehand a go on the books.
I'm happy with how the Gaunt Summoner came out as well, he fits in with the rest of the Chaos units in the box,
but is bright enough to stand out.

That's all the bad guys finished, now onto the heroes!
