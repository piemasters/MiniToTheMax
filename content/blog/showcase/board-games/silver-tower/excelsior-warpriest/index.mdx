## Miniature Review

When first starting on the miniature I thought it was quite plain. There are a lot of flat surfaces, and even the
detailed areas are quite large. However, with the folds in the cloak and the raised emblems on the front it gives the
opportunity to create a lot of contrast which ends up lending itself well to the character.

The Gryph-hound is in a fairly static pose and doesn't look that menacing. It does match the Warpriest's pose, but I
would have liked a more ferocious pose to make players feel that it can deal some real damage in the game.

## Roundup

I've had a lot of practice painting red cloaks on both Grey Knights and Space Wolves so painting most of this miniature
was business as usual. The main difficulty I had was shading and aging the white robe without overdoing it and making
it look too dirty.

With all the miniatures I've been applying a final layer of Munitorum Varnish to protect them. From looking at the
photos it looks like I applied it too fast as it's given the skin a dusty appearance. I'll have to be more careful with
how much ?I apply in the future.
