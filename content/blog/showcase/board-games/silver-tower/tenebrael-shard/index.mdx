## Miniature Review

After my last post saying how unique the Mistweaver was, the Tenebrael Shard actually has a fairly similar pose. It's
really great to see dynamic poses charging and leaping forwards. The hair cleverly adds a lot of mass to the model,
giving the appearance of a lot of weight behind the leap. Without it I think the character would look very light and
delicate.

The pose also adds a lot of height to the miniature. It's great that none of the characters look small, they're all
large and imposing when lined up together. Gone are the days when the Barbarian stand out as the cool miniature and the
other heroes felt like afterthoughts.

## Roundup

I hadn't added blood effects to any of the previous miniatures, but for this one it felt needed. It adds a lot of
sinisterism to the character along with the pale skin and flayed skin. Without it I think the claws would be mistaken
for pointy fingers, and the red on the armour would seem like plain old paint.

Finally, that's the last one. The next post will be a roundup of the Silver Tower boxset, before I move onto the next
project!
