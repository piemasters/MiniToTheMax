## Miniature Review

My thoughts on the Pink Horrors are very similar to what I previously wrote about the Blue Horrors.
It's a shame there aren't two different sculpts, but understandable for the price. The details around the face are great
and all the creases lend themselves well for applying heavy washes.

These guys are surprisingly large and tower over a lot of the other miniatures in the box. The raised arm and wide
stance give them real size and there's a lot more points of interest on them than the Blue Horrors which is great to
see.

## Painting Techniques

Something I learnt from the Blue Horrors was to avoid drybrushing when working on large flat areas you want
to appear smooth. Rather than starting dark and drybrushing lighter colours, I started with a white basecoat and applied
multiple layers of thinned down Fulgrim Pink, Emperors Children and Pink Horror.

I used Hexwraith Flame as the accent colour for the gems and flames, and I used a darker blue on the feathers to give
them a faded appearance. I went with gold for the armour to tie them in with the base.

Instructions for the bases can be found [here](/showcase/board-games/silver-tower/kairic-acolytes/).

## Roundup

These are my favorite miniatures so far in the box. They have a huge amount of character, and it was fun to paint using
mostly washes.

Looking back at the Blue Horrors I painted the magical fire orange to tie them into the Brimstone Horrors.
I should have painted the flames on the Pink Horrors blue to tie them in, but it didn't occur to me.
Really I should have used Nighthaunt Gloom. Oh well, I'm happy with the final result and at least the tongue is blue!
