## Miniature Review

It's a bit of a shame that with only 4 miniatures only 2 sculpts have been used, especially with the unique poses.
I guess it's just one of those things to keep the cost of the box down.

It's great to see the dynamic poses of them rushing forwards, something that has really improved over the last few
years. Although the miniatures don't have a lot of detail on the back, the faces and hands make up for it with great
expressions and detail to really bring them to life.

## Painting Techniques

Most of the blue horrors I've seen have been almost completely blue, with only a bit of white/bone as an accent.
I wanted to add a bit more of a mystical touch by adding in different shades of blue as well as some purple, almost as
a bruising effect. I also made the bone a lot darker than I normally see to show the age of these creatures.

For both the eyes and the tongue I went with a warm purplish red to contrast with the rest of the miniature. I also
added a purple wash to the metals. The fire was painted in the same way as the
[Brimstone Horrors](/showcase/board-games/silver-tower/brimstone-horrors/) to tie them together.

Instructions for the bases can be found [here](/showcase/board-games/silver-tower/kairic-acolytes/).

## Roundup

Once again these guys were fairly simple and quick to paint. With the lighting from the photos the drybrushing shows
up a lot more. They look much smoother in real life, but could still use a thin layer to really smooth the skin out.

For now, I'd rather get onto the final set of horrors and apply what I've learnt from these guys!
