## Miniature Review

This is the first Sigmarine I've seen in person and actually it's not as bad as I thought it would be. I think there's
just enough differentiation between its armour and regular Space Marine armour that it doesn't look out of place in a
fantasy setting.

The miniature itself is similar to the Warpriest. There's not a huge amount of detail, and the details that are in it
are large. This means a lot of contrast is needed to give it some interest. I appreciate the cutouts for the runes on
the scrolls as even now my freehand text is awful and something I really want to improve.

## Painting Techniques

### Silver
<Paint name={'Leadbelcher'} />
<Paint name={'Nuln Oil'} />
<Paint name={'Leadbelcher'} />
<Paint name={'Runefang Steel'} />
<Paint name={'Necron Compound'} />

### Gold
<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Liberator Gold'} />

### Red
<Paint name={'Khorne Red'} />
<Paint name={'Mephiston Red'} />
<Paint name={'Evil Sunz Scarlet'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Mephiston Red'} />
<Paint name={'Evil Sunz Scarlet'} />
<Paint name={'Wild Rider Red'} />

### Scrolls
<Paint name={'Morghast Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Rakarth Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Agrax Earthshade'} />
<Paint name={'Seraphim Sepia'} />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} />
<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />

The Agrax Earthshade was applied to the recesses, while the Seraphim Sepia was applied as a thin layer all over.

### Cloth (Blue)
<Paint name={'Kantor Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Altdorf Guard Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Teclis Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Drakenhof Nightshade'} />
<Paint name={'Nuln Oil'} />
<Paint name={'Teclis Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Lothern Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

When applying the Altdorf Guard Blue, leave the deepest recesses Kantor Blue. Repeat this for the Teclis Blue.
Apply the Drakenhof Nightshade over everything to help blend the colours together, then focus the Nuln Oil in the
recesses to add further contrast.

The Teclis Blue was applied to the raised and flat areas, while the Lothern Blue was applied on the sharp edges with a
very thin layer of Corax White along the middle of the sharpest edges.

### Cloth (White)
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />
<Paint name={'Seraphim Sepia'} />
<Paint name={'Drakenhof Nightshade'} />
<Paint name={'Corax White'} />

The Seraphim Sepia was heavily thinned and focussed around recesses, while the Drakenhof Nightshade was used to help
blend with blue cloth.

Instructions for the bases can be found [here](/showcase/board-games/silver-tower/kairic-acolytes/).

## Roundup

I think I went a bit overboard on the highlighting of blue cloak as it doesn't really look natural. Having said that
though I really like the result, and it really makes the character pop.

I'm also surprised how well the armour came out. After the basecoat and initial shade I didn't spend a huge amount of
time highlighting it as it looked pretty great already. I was more liberal with my use of Munitorum Varnish this time
and it looks better, but sadly the gold did lose a bit of its shine.
