## Miniature Review

This is the first Sigmarine I've seen in person and actually it's not as bad as I thought it would be. I think there's
just enough differentiation between its armour and regular Space Marine armour that it doesn't look out of place in a
fantasy setting.

The miniature itself is similar to the Warpriest. There's not a huge amount of detail, and the details that are in it
are large. This means a lot of contrast is needed to give it some interest. I appreciate the cutouts for the runes on
the scrolls as even now my freehand text is awful and something I really want to improve.

## Roundup

I think I went a bit overboard on the highlighting of blue cloak as it doesn't really look natural. Having said that
though I really like the result, and it really makes the character pop.

I'm also surprised how well the armour came out. After the basecoat and initial shade I didn't spend a huge amount of
time highlighting it as it looked pretty great already. I was more liberal with my use of Munitorum Varnish this time
and it looks better, but sadly the gold did lose a bit of its shine.
