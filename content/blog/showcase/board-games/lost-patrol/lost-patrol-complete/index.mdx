> Moraz III — a deadly jungle world filled with danger and fear, populated by ferocious aliens who wait in the

> A dropship containing vitally important surveillance files has crash landed on this hostile planet. It’s up to you and
> your squad of Space Marine Scouts to retrieve these files, activate the dropship, and hopefully escape with your lives

I remember playing this game years ago when it came out, and I remember just how frustratingly hard it was back then, so
for now I've decided not to frustrate myself and play it, just take some photos of it all together.

Having a game like this fully painted is so great and makes a real difference. I can now add it to the list of
completed games, along with Silver Tower and Dreadfleet.

Maybe one day I'll play it again and maybe write a short review, but for now here's a few photos of some Space Marine
Scouts about to be slaughtered in the jungle by an infinite swarm of genestealers.
