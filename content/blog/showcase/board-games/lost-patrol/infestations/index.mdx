## Miniature Review

These infestations are fairly simple but look great on the board. A lot nicer than cardboard tokens. There's not much
else to say, they're just tentacles with jaws!

## Painting Techniques

### Tentacles
<Paint name={'Volupus Pink'} />
<Paint name={'Wraithbone'} />
<Paint name={'Terminatus Stone'} />
<Paint name={'Wrack White'} />
<Paint name={'Praxeti White'} />

### Jaws
<Paint name={'Phoenician Purple'} />
<Paint name={'Genestealer Purple'} />
<Paint name={'Flesh Tearers Red'} />
<Paint name={'Kakophoni Purple'} />
<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />

Flesh Tearers Red was added as a wash in the recesses of the mouth, and the Screaming Skull was used to pick out the
teeth.

## Roundup

I painted them in the same colours as the Genestealers, again using the airbrush. Things went a little smoother this
time, but there's still a huge amount oif room for improvement!
