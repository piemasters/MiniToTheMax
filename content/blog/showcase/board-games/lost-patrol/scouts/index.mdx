## Miniature Review

To begin with I wasn't sure if I should paint these guys as Space Wolves, so I could use them in my main army, or
paint them as Blood Angels as they are on the box. In the end I didn't think they really looked Space Wolfy enough, and
I didn't want to spend time converting them, so I just went with the box to keep things simple and get them done
quickly.

As with the Genestealers, these Scouts looks fairly dated compared to the modern Primaris marines with all the same hair
cuts and similar poses. There's not really much detail on them either, which at least makes them easy to paint.

After applying the basecoat I used [Base Ready Scrublands](https://www.geekgamingscenics.com/collections/base-ready-range/products/lukes-aps-base-ready-scrublands)
and then added a few [Verdia Veldt Tufts](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/citadel-colour-tufts-verdia-veldt-2021).

## Roundup

No airbrush this time but keeping with a limited colour palette really helped to make these guys quick to paint. I spent
most of my time focusing on highlighting where the light hits their armour rather than just edge highlighting for the
first time. I think I went a bit overboard with how bright I made it in areas, but I really like the effect and will
keep practicing it in the future.

They're maybe a little brighter than I would normally like, but having miniatures I'm not a massive fan of let me try
out some new techniques that I wouldn't normally risk, so in the end painting them was a really useful experience!
