> Daggok Finksteala is on a murderous mission to decapitate the brightest and best fighters within the Deathgorge.
> With each head he takes, his kunnin' increases - or so he believes - and he means to gather enough smarts to make him
> a Killaboss. His warband, da Stab-Ladz, shares his vision and assists him in his underhanded ambushes with their
> savagery and kunnin'.

## Miniature Review

Daggok's Stab-Ladz is an aggressive warband that rewards players who use their kunnin' to complete special Scheme
gambits with extra Glory points.

Hurrk da Howla is Daggok's herald and bears a horn called the Roar of Kragnos after the terrifying noise it makes
when sounded. Grakk da Hook uses his bita-flail to yank enemies off-balance, and Jagz da Bleeda - a sadist feared even
by other Kruelboyz - explodes into violence when a weakness is exposed.

The set comes with some decent unique sculpts. There are warbands that are a lot more interesting, but these guys
will fit into a unit of Gutrippaz fairly easily whereas a lot of other warbands won't really fit into their matching
army in the same way.

## Roundup

I went a bit brighter with the wood and did a bit more wet blending to give the miniatures a bit more interest as
they're quite plain otherwise. I also spend a bit more time around their faces as in most cases they're even more of
the centerpoint than others in the army.
