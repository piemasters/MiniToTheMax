> The Briar Queen was once a death mage of formidable power, a great enemy of Shadespire whose undead armies breached
> the city walls and threatened to tear down all that the Katophranes had built. Only after unthinkable bloodshed was
> the Briar Queen defeated, captured and sentenced to an eternity of imprisonment and torment in the Nightvault, far
> beneath the city streets. Years passed, and this agonising existence slowly drove the Briar Queen to madness.
>
> Trapped for centuries in a cell of obsidian shadeglass, she was consumed by misery and despair, yet an ember of
> hatred for those who had condemned her to this fate still lingered. She was the perfect tool for Nagash to unleash
> upon those who dared to trespass within the Mirrored City. The Great Necromancer dragged her screaming essence from
> her crystal tomb and fashioned her inchoate malice into the dread form of a banshee, with her former mastery of
> necromantic magic still intact.
