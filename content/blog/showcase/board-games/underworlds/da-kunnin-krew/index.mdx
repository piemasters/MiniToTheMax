## Miniature Review

Mannok da Kunnin is an Orruk Breaka-Boss of the Grinnin' Blades warclan and the Beast-Breakaz tribe, who controls the
Da Kunnin' Krew. He is armed with a Try-prodda and a cruel Lash that are envenomed with a poison that can turn their
foes, even the toughest into spasming wrecks.

Torka Tuffskul is an Orruk of the Grinnin' Blades and the leader of Da Kunnin' Krew. He is armed with a spiked
Mansnappa and is an expert at corralling foes with it. He also wears armour into combat.

Shank is a Grot of the Grinnin' Blades and a member of Da Kunnin' Krew. He is kept in line by the malicious paymaster
Krookgrin and will not desert him as long as he stands. He is armed with a Krule Net.

Krookgrin is a Hobgrot of the Grinnin' Blades and the malicious paymaster of Da Kunnin' Krew. As long as he stands the
rest of the crew will not desert him and the grots will be kept in line. He is armed with a Krule Dagger.

Gikkit is a Grot of the Grinnin' Blades and a member of Da Kunnin' Krew. He is kept in line by the malicious paymaster

## Roundup

I wasn't sure how far to go with the red, but I wanted to make it clear how high ranking each member was. This meant
none really for the hobgrots, and a similar amount between Mannok da Kunnin and Torka Tuffskul as I imagine them
fighting for overall leadership.

I had seen someone paint them with a really dark armour that I might still prefer, but I'm happy with how the unit came
out and they fit in nicely with the rest of my army.
