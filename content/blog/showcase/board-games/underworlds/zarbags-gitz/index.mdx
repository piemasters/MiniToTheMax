> The Moonclan Shaman Zarbag and his scuttling band are an infestation spreading through the heart of the Mirrored City.
> While looting the ruins of Shadespire, Zarbag sniffed out a tantalising aroma of fungal spores drifting up from deep
> underground. Pursuing this tempting lure, the Shaman and his grots tunnelled into an enormous sinkhole, tumbling
> into darkness. They crashed to earth in the depths of the Mirrored City, finding themselves lost within the
> Thanatological Gardens of the city's former Katophrane masters.
>
> Where once vibrant flowerbeds and lush plantations filled these glass-domed halls, now there were only fields of
> choking mould and towering clusters of deffcap mushrooms - everything Zarbag had wished for and more! The Shaman has
> taken it upon himself to spread this noxious fungus far and wide, drawing more and more of his numberless kin into
> the Mirrored City.

## Miniature Review

This warband includes 9 rather eccentric, deffcap-addled Grots including Zarbag, Snirk Sourtongue, Prog Da Netter,
Stikkit, RedKap, Dibbz, Drizgit Da Squig Herder, Bonekrakka and Gobbaluk. I really like the variety within the warband,
having a couple of squigs, a netter, a shaman, some archers and a few fighters. The sculpts are full of character and
the poses are really varied, some looking pretty silly while others are trying to look menacing.

## Base

The cave is made from corkboard and the ground was covered in a texture paint. As with the squig I gave everything a
shade with Nuln Oil to darken it right down, then highlighted it back up with Dawnstone and Mechanicus Grey.

I then applied a mix of flocks, rocks, tufts, flowers and leaves grouped below by company:
