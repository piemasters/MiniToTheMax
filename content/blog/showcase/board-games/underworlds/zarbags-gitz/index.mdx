> The Moonclan Shaman Zarbag and his scuttling band are an infestation spreading through the heart of the Mirrored City.
> While looting the ruins of Shadespire, Zarbag sniffed out a tantalising aroma of fungal spores drifting up from deep
> underground. Pursuing this tempting lure, the Shaman and his grots tunnelled into an enormous sinkhole, tumbling
> into darkness. They crashed to earth in the depths of the Mirrored City, finding themselves lost within the
> Thanatological Gardens of the city’s former Katophrane masters.
>
> Where once vibrant flowerbeds and lush plantations filled these glass-domed halls, now there were only fields of
> choking mould and towering clusters of deffcap mushrooms – everything Zarbag had wished for and more! The Shaman has
> taken it upon himself to spread this noxious fungus far and wide, drawing more and more of his numberless kin into
> the Mirrored City.
