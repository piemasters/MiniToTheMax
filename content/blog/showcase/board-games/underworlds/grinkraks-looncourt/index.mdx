## Miniature Review

Grinkrak and his Looncourt are an unusual warband, weighing in at seven models, they're one of the largest warbands
in the game. The warband contains Grinkrak the Great, Snorbo da Spore, Pokin' Snark, Pointy Burk, Moonface Nagz,
Skolko and Pronk, and Grib, da Wonky Lance.

Grib, da Wonky Lance is the standout model in the warband, with a unique pose looking just like a knight, while the
squig is far more beefy than the usual. I also really like the squig missile models, Skolko and Pronk, they really add
something different to the warband not really seen much in the Gloomspite Gitz range. The squig on a stick is also a
fun idea.

## Base

The cave is made from corkboard and the ground was covered in a texture paint. As with the squig I gave everything a
shade with Nuln Oil to darken it right down, then highlighted it back up with Dawnstone and Mechanicus Grey.

I then applied a mix of flocks, rocks, tufts, flowers and leaves grouped below by company:
