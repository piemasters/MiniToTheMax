## Miniature Review

The Crows Nest is a massive piece of scenery for a board game. It's taken a lot of inspiration from
St Mark's Clocktower with the roof of Giotto's Bell Tower. It's got a great amount of detail on it, from the tile roof,
the flower like patterning, the status and other stonework, the door and windows and even the metal work.

I do wonder how much of an obstacle it would be in a game, but as a display piece it's fantastic. Oh, and the hay in
the cart is a great addition and really reminds me of the hay bales in Assassin's Creed II.

## Painting Techniques

### Stone

<Paint name={'Tallarn Sand'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Zandri Dust'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Karak Stone'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Terminatus Stone'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Typhon Ash'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Seraphim Sepia'} />
<Paint name={'Militarum Green'} />
<Paint name={'Wraithbone'} />

For the lower darker brown stone sections I then applied a thinned down layer of Snakebite Leather.

<Paint name={'Snakebite Leather'} />

### Blue & Gold Pattern

<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Asurmen Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />

I first painted the entire area gold, then applied the blue contrast paint over the top so only so much of the gold
showed through. This helped create a smoother transition between the two colors. I then drybrushed back over very
lightly with gold to bring back the color and shine. This required a number of very light layers to avoid covering the
blue and to really bring out the gold.

### Wood

<Paint name={'Wyldwood'} />
<Paint name={'Gore Grunta Fur'} />
<Paint name={'Skrag Brown'} />

### Roof

<Paint name={'Gryph Hound Orange'} />
<Paint name={'Jokaero Orange'} />
<Paint name={'Lugganath Orange'} />

### Gold

<Paint name={'Sotek Green'} />
<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Reikland Fleshshade'} />
<Paint name={'Liberator Gold'} />

### Steel

<Paint name={'Leadbelcher'} />
<Paint name={'Nuln Oil'} />
<Paint name={'Ironbreaker'} />

I then added a few patches of dirty down rust.

### Windows

<Paint name={'Temple Guard Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Tyran Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Temple Guard Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Baharroth Blue'} />
<Paint name={'White Scar'} />
<Paint name={'Ardcoat'} />

## Roundup

It took a bit of work to get the brickwork right and I did end up going back over some areas with the same colors just
to get the shading right, not too clean but not too dirty either. Overall I'm really pleased with how this turned out
and it's a great display piece that I've put on top of my Kalax that holds all my board games.
