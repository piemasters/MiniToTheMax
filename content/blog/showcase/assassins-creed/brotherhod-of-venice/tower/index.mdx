## Miniature Review

Like the Crows Nest, it's taken a lot of inspiration from St Mark's Clocktower with the roof of Giotto's Bell Tower.
It has a lot of the same details as the Crows Nest, but rather than the roof it has some large statues and bell, and
rather than a window shutters it has a clock face on two sides and a detailed carving on the other two sides.

It is maybe a little less Assassin's Creed than the Crows Nest, with no obvious spot to jump off, but the extra detail
looks great and despite a lot of similarity it looks different enough and in those areas I think actually looks better
than the Crows Nest.

## Painting Techniques

### Stone

<Paint name={'Tallarn Sand'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Zandri Dust'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Karak Stone'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Terminatus Stone'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Ushabti Bone'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Typhon Ash'} category="Citadel Air" />
<Paint name={'Seraphim Sepia'} />
<Paint name={'Militarum Green'} />
<Paint name={'Wraithbone'} />

For the lower darker brown stone sections I then applied a thinned down layer of Snakebite Leather.

<Paint name={'Snakebite Leather'} />

### Blue & Gold Pattern

<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Asurmen Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />

I first painted the entire area gold, then applied the blue contrast paint over the top so only so much of the gold
showed through. This helped create a smoother transition between the two colors. I then drybrushed back over very
lightly with gold to bring back the color and shine. This required a number of very light layers to avoid covering the
blue and to really bring out the gold.

### Wood

<Paint name={'Wyldwood'} />
<Paint name={'Gore Grunta Fur'} />
<Paint name={'Skrag Brown'} />

### Gold

<Paint name={'Sotek Green'} />
<Paint name={'Retributor Armour'} />
<Paint name={'Reikland Fleshshade'} />
<Paint name={'Liberator Gold'} />

### Bronze

<Paint name={'Sotek Green'} />
<Paint name={'Castellax Bronze'} />
<Paint name={'Reikland Fleshshade'} />
<Paint name={'Sycorax Bronze'} />

### Steel

<Paint name={'Leadbelcher'} />
<Paint name={'Nuln Oil'} />
<Paint name={'Ironbreaker'} />

I then added a few patches of dirty down rust.

### Windows

<Paint name={'Temple Guard Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Tyran Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Temple Guard Blue'} />
<Paint name={'Baharroth Blue'} />
<Paint name={'White Scar'} />
<Paint name={'Ardcoat'} />

### Hay

<Paint name={'Nazdreg Yellow'} />
<Paint name={'Iyanden Yellow'} />
<Paint name={'Phalanx Yellow'} />

## Roundup

It's not an exact match to the Crows Nest, but it's close enough and is potentially more realistic that it's not
the exact same. Having more windows and the clock faces adds a lot more blue to the piece and helps each stand out,
but still look great next to each other.
