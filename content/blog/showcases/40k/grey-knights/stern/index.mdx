> Brother-Captain Arvann Stern is an elite Daemonhunter and one of the longest-serving and most highly decorated Captains of the elite Grey Knights Space Marine Chapter. Even from his earliest years as a Grey Knight, Stern was believed to be well on his way to becoming one of the Chapter's Grand Masters, but instead his life took an altogether different course. Throughout his nearly four Terran centuries of service to the Emperor he has been confronted by his mortal enemy, the Lord of Change known as M'Kachen. The Greater Daemon has continued to interfere with the Stern's fate since their first meeting such that for every act of heroism or bravery performed in battle by the valiant Grey Knight, some inexplicable misfortune also befalls him.

After painting my first Grey Knight 10 man squad, I thought it would be nice to take a break from batch painting and focus on a single character. From my collection I thought Brother Captain Stern was a good choice to start with.

Since he's a character I added an extra layer to the base to make him stand out that much more, along with a different coloured nemesis force weapon. I'm pretty happy with the purple effect, I just feel it doesn't quite fit with the rest of the paint job. Maybe I should have included more purple in the rest of the model.

It was also one of my first serious attempts at painting text. It's far from perfect, but it's a reasonable attempt and doesn't look too out of place like previous attempts.
