## Base Coat

<Paint name={'Bugmans Glow'} />
<Paint name={'Kislev Flesh'} />
<Paint name={'Flayed One Flesh'} />

These steps should be completed with an airbrush as it's much easier to get the shadows and highlights correct.

### Step 1

<Paint name={'Bugmans Glow'} />

Cover the face completely with a reddish flesh color. This could be replaced with a deep purple for older
skin. Other colors can be used for different effects, even using green for orcs.

### Step 2

<Paint name={'Kislev Flesh'} />

Spray Kislev Flesh directly from above, then pull down from the front to a 45 degree angle. This leaves the darker
shade in the shadowed areas but applies the base color for the skin.

### Step 3

<Paint name={'Flayed One Flesh'} />

Spray the Flayed One Flesh directly from above, then pull down again from the front at a much smaller angle. This
applies the brightest highlights to the face.

### Step 4

Apply a gloss varnish. This will make applying the followup glazing steps much easier and will result in a smoother
result. You can also black out all other details other than the skin to help prevent distraction.

## Contouring

<Paint name={'Doombull Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Rhinox Hide'} />

### Step 1

<Paint name={'Doombull Brown'} />

Glaze the entire head with a reddish tone very thinly. Apply a second layer if needed to change the hue more. This
step is to darken the skin slightly, allowing the skin to be highlighted back up to the previous step 3 highlight
without having to go with a lighter color.

### Step 2

<Paint name={'Mournfang Brown'} />
<Paint name={'Rhinox Hide'} />

Apply a medium brown as a semi-opaque wash very finely into the recessed areas to tint the shadows. Focus under the
eyes, around the ears, cheeks and along the hairline. Keep the face held towards you to help ensure the shadows are
placed correctly. Once complete repeat this step with a darker brown where the darkest areas would be.

### Step 3

<Paint name={'Flayed One Flesh'} />

Apply the base coat step 3 color as a first highlight. Apply it to the nose first to check that it isn't too stark
against the glazed skin. If it is you will need to find a darker tone to highlight, but as the nose will be the
brightest you won't have just made a mistake.

### Step 4

<Paint name={'Screaming Skull'} />

As a final highlight apply tiny dots to the highest points such as the nose and the eyebrows.
