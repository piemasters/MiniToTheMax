> A Grey Knight Terminator is a superlative warrior whose status as an elite amongst the elite forms the heart of the Grey Knights Space Marine Chapter's forces. These warriors pursue the endless war against the daemons of Chaos. Armoured in superior suits of Tactical Dreadnought Armour, they face the vile horrors of the Warp, always outnumbered by the baying foe.

So yet another squad is ticked off. This time it's a smaller squad, a 5 man Terminator Squad updated from its original paint job 11 years ago. These terminators are almost the last of my older metal models painted, which is a relief as they are definitely that much harder to paint as the paint rubs off very easily.

The sculpts themselves still look great, even compared to today's standards. They are the models that originally got me onto Grey Knights from my original Space Wolf and Orc army. Over 10 years later I've been drawn back to them.

Here’s a photo of how they looked like before:

To be fair, other than the terrible old style bases the paint job on them, considering I was around 12, wasn't too bad. The paint scheme wasn't too far off my current scheme, my new scheme just has a larger focus on shading and highlighting.

Hopefully you'll agree that these terminators have received a considerable upgrade! I've tried two different styles of photography, let me know in the comments below which you prefer!
